Describe and interpret these scans

**IMAGE INTERPRETATION** 



**Image 1** : Longitudinal view of the Achilles tendon, beginning at the calcaneal insertion and slowly moving cranially. 


The complete rupture is seen at the musculotendinous intersection.


**CLINICAL CORRELATION** 



**Achilles tendon rupture** 


Dynamic assessment of the site of injury is a useful addition. Hold the transducer over the site of injury and gently dorsiflex the foot. The two ends of the Achilles rupture will separate if it is complete.
