Describe and interpret these scans

**IMAGE INTERPRETATION** 



**Image 1** : Apical 4 chamber view: 


There is a large pericardial effusion with some associated right sided chamber collapse. There pericardial fluid is echogenic with fine homogeneous echoes seen throughout. 


**CLINICAL CORRELATION** 



**Large echogenic pericardial effusion with associated right sided chamber collapse.** 


The echogenic nature of the pericardial fluid means it is not a transudate but otherwise is not particularly specific. 


Blood, proteinaceous exudate from malignancy or autoimmune inflammatory processes, or purulent fluid from infectious causes can all have a similar appearance.
