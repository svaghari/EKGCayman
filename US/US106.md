**IMAGE INTERPRETATION** 



**Image 1** : Gallbladder: This longitudinal view of the GB shows mild wall thickening, a single large stone in the neck of the GB (which did not move with patient positioning – including decubitus and erect positions). A few echogenic foci within the GB demonstrate comet tail artefact and are typical of cholesterol crystals.

**Image 2** : Right kidney: This longitudinal view of the right kidney shows mild to moderate hydronephrosis with distension of the renal calyces. There is proximal hydroureter and a 5mm echogenic pelvi-ureteric junction stone is seen.

**CLINICAL CORRELATION** 



**Renal colic and biliary colic** 


Ketogenic diet may be associated with higher incident of renal calculi formation. It also causes rapid weight loss and hyperlipidaemia, both might increase the risk for the development of cholelithiasis.
