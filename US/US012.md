Describe and interpret these scans

**IMAGE INTERPRETATION** 



**Image 1** : Parasternal long axis of the heart with a large right heart and septum bowing into the left ventricle. 



**Image 2:**  Parasternal short axis of the heart, again showing a large right heart and a “D” shaped septum consistent with right heart strain. 



**Image 3** : Longitudinal view of the IVC shows a plethoric IVC with spontaneous echo contrast. 



**Image 4** : Femoral veins were compressed proximally and collapsed, showing no proximal femoral venous DVT. 



**Image 5** : After the patient arrested, tPA 50 mg IV bolus was given, ROSC was achieved and the right heart strain is showing improvement. 


**CLINICAL CORRELATION** 


Massive pulmonary embolism and cardiac arrest.
