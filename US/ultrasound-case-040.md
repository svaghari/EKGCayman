Describe and interpret these scans

**IMAGE INTERPRETATION** 



**Image 1** : Left iliac fossa, transducer aligned along descending colon. There is a segment of thickened aperistaltic bowel wall with thickness of 6mm (normal ≤3mm). There is loss of the normal haustra coli. 



**Image 2** : Addition of Colour Doppler. There is transmural hypervascularity. 



**Image 3** : There is associated mesenteric lymphadenopathy. 



**Image 4** : Left iliac fossa, transverse view of descending colon.



**Image 5** : Layers of the bowel wall.

**CLINICAL CORRELATION** 



**Inflammatory bowel disease – Crohn’s disease** 


Differentiating ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease is generally done histologically. However, there are ultrasound features which may guide the clinician toward a favored diagnosis.
