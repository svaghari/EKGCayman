Describe and interpret these scans

**IMAGE INTERPRETATION** 



**Image 1** : Transverse view of left side of the scrotum: 


As the probe sweeps inferiorly over the cord to the testis the cord is seen twisting through at least 360 degrees. Reversing the sweep back up the cord and the twist is again seen. This “whirlpool sign” is pathognomonic of testicular torsion and requires urgent intervention. 



**Image 2 & 3** : In this case testicular flow can still be detected on colour and power Doppler.


**CLINICAL CORRELATION** 



**Testicular torsion**  with preserved flow and sonographically evident twisted cord – the **whirlpool sign** 


Detecting blood flow within a testis does not exclude the diagnosis of testicular torsion. Intermittent testicular torsion or torsion-detorsion may cause intermittent pain and intermittent ischaemia. Incomplete torsion is where despite some degree of torsion of the cord, blood flow has not been completely occluded.
