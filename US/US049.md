# Ultrasound Case 049
Presentation


A 44 year old woman presents with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain radiating through to her back. She has a fever and is tender on abdominal palpation. She has had several episodes of postprandial RUQ discomfort previously. You wonder if she has gallstones.

Describe and interpret these scans

**IMAGE INTERPRETATION** 



**Image 1** : Transverse view of the gallbladder fanning from the neck through to the fundus. 


There is a large gallstone obstructing the neck of the gallbladder. It has a typical appearance with an echogenic anterior surface and dense dark posterior acoustic shadowing. The gallbladder wall is markedly thickened at 12mm (≤3mm) with striations reflecting oedema within the wall. There is some dependent sludge distal to the stone.

**Image 3** : Transverse image of gallbladder through the stone. 



**Image 4** : Normal common bile duct.


**CLINICAL CORRELATION** 



**Acute cholecystitis** 


Biliary ultrasound is frequently complex with highly varied appearances and pathology. Accurate imaging and interpretation requires considerable expertise and experience. 


The typical sonographic features of cholecystitis can include: 
- Dilation of the gallbladder (transverse diameter >4cm)
- Gallstones and sludge particularly a stone lodged within the GB neck or cystic duct.
- Increased GB wall thickness (>3mm) 
- Hyperaemia of the GB wall. 
- Pericholecystic fluid
- Tenderness to transducer pressure over the gallbladder (sonographic [Murphy’s sign](https://litfl.com/murphys-sign-eponymictionary/)) 


 Among the numerous pitfalls are: 
- Incorrectly identifying the gallbladder – confusing it for bowel or vice versa. 
- Missing a stone caught in the GB neck or cystic duct
- Attributing a thickened gallbladder wall to cholecystitis when it is due to another cause – and there are many for example adjacent inflammatory conditions such as hepatitis, pancreatitis or pyelonephritis.
- Not realizing the case is one of the many exceptions to the rules – such as acalculous cholecystitis – with no stones, or severe cholecystitis with absence of gallbladder wall hyperaemia, or a non tender gallbladder wall which occasionally happens in cholecystitis particularly in the elderly, or ascites thought to be inflammatory pericholecystic fluid…
