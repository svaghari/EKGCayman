# Ultrasound Case 025
Presentation


A 70 year old man presents with gradually increasing shortness of breath. He has had some weight loss. His CXR shows a very large left side probable pleural effusion. You wonder whether it is consolidation, solid tumour, a simple pleural effusion or a complex pleural effusion. 


You put your ultrasound probe on the chest, what is the cause?

Describe and interpret these scans

**IMAGE INTERPRETATION** 



**Image 1 & 2: Left posterior axillary line lower chest wall.** 


There are multiple solid pleural based lesions, either metastases or primary tumour of the mesothelium. These are on the diaphragm, the parietal and visceral pleural surfaces. There is a moderate amount of relatively anechoic fluid in the pleural space but it is certainly not a simple effusion. No normal lung tissue is seen in these views.


**CLINICAL CORRELATION** 



**Pleural based metastatic deposits with associated effusion.** 


Unilateral near white out on a chest x-ray has numerous differentials and ultrasound is an excellent means of differentiating. 


First determine the level of the diaphragm. Sometimes an elevated hemidiaphragm is playing a large part in the appearance. 


Assess what lies above the diaphragm. Solid tumour, large pleural effusion or consolidation may all have similar appearances on plain x-ray. Ultrasound will differentiate these, which often occur in combination as in this case.
