Describe and interpret these scans

**IMAGE INTERPRETATION** 



**Image 1** : Fanning through the long axis of the gallbladder fossa. 


This lovely clip shows how difficult it can be to differentiate gas within the lumen of bowel from a gallbladder packed with tiny stones. The clip shows the liver edge covering gas filled bowel and then fans to show the wall-echo-shadow pattern typical of a gallbladder tightly packed with small stones.

Key to Explain Bowel appearance.


**CLINICAL CORRELATION** 



**Cholelithiasis with the WES sign** 


Air and stones can appear similar on ultrasound. 

- Air casts a dirty grey shadow. 
- Stone casts a darker cleaner acoustic shadow. 



**Wall-echo-shadow (WES)**  sign: first there is the echogenic gallbladder wall, then a very thin rim of hypoechoic bile, then the echogenic surface may by innumerable small gallstones, and finally the dark and clean acoustic shadow.
