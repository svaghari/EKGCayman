Describe and interpret these scans

**IMAGE INTERPRETATION** 



**Image 1** : Longitudinal transducer position mid anterior chest. Initially at the sternal notch it is slid caudally to the cartilaginous sterno-manubrial angle then on down the midline of the sterum. 


The sternum has several ossification centres. The cartilaginous junctions between the sternebrae are seen as hypoechoic lines across the sternum. 


The 2nd rib comes off at the sternomabubrial junction, the 3rd at the junction between the first and second sternebae, and so on. 


These are not fractures. 


**CLINICAL CORRELATION** 



**Normal paediatric sternum.** 


At each of the hypoechoic cartilaginous junctions between the sternebrae there is a gentle ridge. Again this should not be interpreted as a buckle type fracture. These ridges persist variably into adulthood.
