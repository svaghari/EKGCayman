Describe and interpret these scans

**IMAGE INTERPRETATION** 



**Image 1:**  A moderate sized pleural effusion is present. Fanning through the effusion the descending aorta is seen, then the heart â€“ which is surrounded by a large pericardial effusion. 



**Image 2:**  Using the echo probe the pericardial effusion is again seen through the pleural effusion. 



**Image 3:**  Subcostal view: taken with the curvilinear probe confirms a large pericardial effusion with some right sided chamber collapse.


**CLINICAL CORRELATION** 



**Pleural effusion and pericardial effusion with echocardiographic signs of tamponade** 


Rapid assessment of the chest in a deteriorating patient with known mesothelioma in whom previous pleural fluid drainage has been performed is extremely useful. 


A pneumothorax, recurrent pleural effusion, or progression of solid malignancy may be playing a part. 


Keeping an open mind is always important and in this case through the pleural effusion a large pericardial effusion is seen.
