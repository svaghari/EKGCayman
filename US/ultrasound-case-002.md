Describe and interpret these scans

**IMAGE INTERPRETATION** 



**Image 1:**  Pneumothorax with loss of lung sliding and loss of short path reverberation artefacts ([comet tail](https://litfl.com/comet-tail-artefact/) and [B-lines](https://litfl.com/short-path-reverberation-artefact/)) 



**Image 2** : Normal lung sliding and [comet tail artefact](https://litfl.com/comet-tail-artefact/) on the asymptomatic side. 



**Image 3:**  Pleural effusion with underlying collapsed lung 



**Image 4:**  Pleural effusion with collapsed lung, but now an air fluid level is seen descending on inspiration. 



**Image 5:**  Linear transducer shows the curved diaphragm moving with inspiration. There is an air fluid level of the haemopneumothorax.


**CLINICAL CORRELATION** 



**Haemopneumothorax** 


A pneumothorax is rapidly detected, as is the basal [pleural effusion](https://litfl.com/lung-ultrasound-pleural-effusion/). 


The air fluid level is often confused with a [lung point](https://litfl.com/lung-ultrasound-lung-point/), but rather than the dynamic point of separation between the parietal and visceral pleural surfaces that is the lung point, this is the site of the junction between air and fluid in a hydropneumothorax. 


Dependent fluid with air above it. The collapsed lung can be seen through the pleural fluid.
