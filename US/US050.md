# Ultrasound Case 050
Presentation


I was sent a small ultrasound machine to test. I asked my 8 year old son if I could scan his aorta. This is the scan which sent a ripple through our lives.

Describe and interpret these scans

**IMAGE INTERPRETATION** 



**Image 1** : Transverse scan abdominal aorta superior to inferior. A homogeneous mass is seen lying in the left retroperitoneum adjacent to the aorta and inferior to the left renal vein.

**Image 2** : Longitudinal view through the left kidney. The mass is seen sitting at the left renal hilum. My heart paused, I got a lump in my throat. What to do â€“ ignore or investigate?

**Image 5** : Nuclear
medicine scan reported as showing a mass consistent with a neural crest
tumour. Neuroblastoma is the most common of these.

**CLINICAL CORRELATION** 



**Schwannoma** 


Histology showed this was a benign schwannoma. Ben has recovered well and we so appreciate the professionalism and kindness shown by those who cared for him and supported us through the adventure. 


Look out for the **incidentaloma** . 


They are common, make for difficult conversations and challenging decision making, and can permanently impact patients lives and those of their families.
