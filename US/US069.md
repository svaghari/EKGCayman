Describe and interpret these scans

**IMAGE INTERPRETATION** 



**Image 1 & 2** : These are images taken fanning through Morrison’s pouch, the first from more anteriorly and the second more laterally in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. 


Both show a moderate amount of anechoic fluid in Morrison’s pouch, with “sharp angles” – as is typical for free fluid fitting into the spaces between rounded organs. 



**Image 3** : Fanning through the left upper quadrant . 


The spleen is seen with free fluid at its tip and a thin strip between the diaphragm and spleen. The loop begins showing the spleen and stomach and then shows the left kidney as the transducer fans posteriorly. 



**Image 4** : Longitudinal view fanning and sweeping through the pelvis from right to left. 


The right paracolic gutter is seen first filled with some free fluid. The bladder and uterus then come into view and fluid is seen in the Pouch of Douglas. Next the left iliac fossa is explored and a rounded heterogeneous mas is seen – clot surrounding the ovary and the ruptured corpus luteum. Finally free fluid is seen in the left paracolic gutter.
