# Ultrasound Case 108
Presentation


An 18 year old presents with progressive pain, swelling and erythema of his distal phalanx. Ten days earlier he had sustained a deep abrasion to the dorsum of his left ring finger whilst playing hockey on artificial grass.


The question was asked: **Is this a simple paronychia?**

Water Bath ultrasound imaging


With the patient’s finger being exquisitely tender the water bath method of digit ultrasound was employed. 



**Method** : Using a water bath can assist in obtaining good quality images in patients suffering painful digits. The finger and the imaging end of the ultrasound probe are submerged. A centimetre or two of water is allowed between the finger and probe enabling complete and accurate imaging without touching the finger.

Ultrasound : Labelled


**IMAGE INTERPRETATION** 



**Clinical Image** . There is swelling and redness over the cuticle with destruction of the proximal nail bed. The appearance was one of paronychia, but the chronicity was unusual. 



**Ultrasound** . Disruption of the dorsal distal phalanx is evident as loss of the normally smooth echogenic cortical surface. 



**Lateral finger X-ray** . The X-ray confirms the destruction of the dorsal cortical surface and likely osteomyelitis. 

**CLINICAL CORRELATION** 



**Distal phalanx osteomyelitis** 


What began as a deep abrasion on the dorsal distal phalanx probably seeded infection from the far from sterile sporting surface into the tissues of the finger, and over time a destructive osteomyelitis developed. Clinically the chronicity and relatively rapid worsening raised suspicion of a more complex process and imaging confirmed the eventual diagnosis. 


When scanning a painful digit high quality ultrasound images can be difficult. The process is painful, and achieving a good window on an irregular and rounded surface is challenging. 


We scanned this finger using a water bath. Water transmits ultrasound and direct contact is not required between probe and finger. In addition near field artefact is eliminated which improves the image. 


Near field artefact: The first few millimetres of image in an ultrasound are usually disturbed by artefact and very superficial imaging is best done using a stand off pad or a water bath.
