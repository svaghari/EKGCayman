**IMAGE INTERPRETATION** 



**Image 1** : Transverse mid abdominal aorta. 



**Image 2** : Longitudinal view abdominal aorta. 


A dissection flap is seen in the abdominal aorta. 


**CLINICAL CORRELATION** 



**Aortic dissection** 


Ultrasound views of the thoracic aorta are more difficult to attain than views of the abdominal aorta. In this case simple abdominal aortic views confirmed the diagnosis and CTA was expedited, confirming the diagnosis of Type A aortic dissection
