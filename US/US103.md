# Ultrasound Case 103 Fire and Brimstone
Presentation


A 38 year old woman presents with midcycle LIF pain. It is colicky and you are asked to scan her pelvis.

Describe and interpret these scans

**IMAGE INTERPRETATION** 



**Image 1:**  Left kidney. Normal left kidney with no hydronephrosis. 



**Image 2:**  Transverse Bladder. Normal left ureteric jet; this excludes a completely obstructing ureteric calculus, but sometimes a stone does not cause complete ureteric obstruction. 



**Image 3:**  Left mid ureter. The ureter crosses the iliac vessels at the pelvic brim. A 5mm echogenic shadow casting lesion is seen within the lumen of a slightly distended ureter. The cause of her pain is ureteric colic. 



**Image 4:**  With colour Doppler the vessels are interrogated. Flow is demonstrated in the iliac vessels, not in the ureter, and the stone demonstrates “twinkle” artefact.

**CLINICAL CORRELATION** 



**Left ureteric colic** 


Renal stones generally cause symptoms when they pass into the ureter. They are known to get stuck at three points – the pelvi-ureteric junction (PUJ), the mid ureter at the pelvic brim as the ureter crosses the iliac vessels, and distally at the vesico-ureteric junction (VUJ). 


In this case the stone is seen at the mid ureter. 


Ultrasound technique: I always search for the mid ureter in patients with suspected renal colic. With the probe placed in the saggital plane I slide the probe along the iliac vessels from origin to groin. A dilated ureter will be seen as a hypoechoic tubular structure running obliquely over the iliac vessels at their mid point. A non dilated normal ureter is usually not seen.
