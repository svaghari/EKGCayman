**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 


This is a repeat ECG of the [previous patient](https://litfl.com/ecg-case-055/) with [massive TCA overdose](https://litfl.com/tricyclic-overdose-sodium-channel-blocker-toxicity/), taken a short while later.

- There is now evidence of advanced [sodium-channel blockade](https://litfl.com/tricyclic-overdose-sodium-channel-blocker-toxicity/), with grossly prolonged QRS and QT intervals and further evolution of the R’ wave in aVR.
- The ECG is beginning to take on bizarre morphology and a sine wave appearance reminiscent of [severe hyperkalaemia](https://litfl.com/hyperkalaemia-ecg-library/).
- In some leads (II, III, aVF), the QRS morphology resembles [ventricular tachycardia](https://litfl.com/ventricular-tachycardia-monomorphic-ecg-library/).


These features are all due to sodium-channel blockade, and resolved
following aggressive treatment with IV bicarbonate, intubation and
hyperventilation.

Resolving TCA toxicity – QRS complexes narrowing and R’ wave disappearing with treatment.

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 


Advanced sodium-channel blockade can resemble either [VT](https://litfl.com/ventricular-tachycardia-monomorphic-ecg-library/) or [hyperkalaemia](https://litfl.com/hyperkalaemia-ecg-library/).


Standard VT treatments such as DC cardioversion and amiodarone are likely to be ineffective and potentially harmful if the broad complex rhythm is due to sodium-channel blockade. Consider the clinical context and look for clues of TCA toxicity (e.g. anticholinergic toxidrome).


In arrested / peri-arrest patients with a broad or bizarre-looking ECG, consider empirical treatment for both [hyperkalaemia](https://litfl.com/hyperkalaemia-ecg-library/) (with calcium) and [sodium-channel blockade](https://litfl.com/tricyclic-overdose-sodium-channel-blocker-toxicity/) (with bicarbonate and hyperventilation).
