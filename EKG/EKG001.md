**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 



**General:** 

- Sinus rhythm, rate 84bpm
- Normal axis
- [1st degree AV block](https://litfl.com/first-degree-heart-block-ecg-library/) (PR 220ms)



**Signs of [inferior STEMI](https://litfl.com/inferior-stemi-ecg-library/):** 

- STE in inferior leads II, III, aVF
- Reciprocal STD in lateral leads I, aVL, V6



**Signs of associated [right ventricular infarction](https://litfl.com/right-ventricular-infarction-ecg-library/):** 

- STE in III > II
- STE in V1-2


This patient also had STE in V4R, confirming the diagnosis of RV infarction:

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 

- RV infarction complicates 40% of inferior STEMIs
- Suggestive features include:
	- ST elevation in V1, the only lead that looks directly at the RV
	- ST elevation in III > II, as lead III is more rightward facing
- Diagnosis can be confirmed with right-sided leads
- These patients are preload sensitive and may have an exaggerated hypotensive response to nitrates
