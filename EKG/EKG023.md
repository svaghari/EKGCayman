**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 



**Main Abnormalities** 



**** This ECG demonstrates the key features of sotalol toxicity:

- [Sinus bradycardia](https://litfl.com/sinus-bradycardia-ecg-library/) (42 bpm)
- Very long [QT interval](https://litfl.com/qt-interval-ecg-library/) (~600 ms)


Sotalol is a beta blocker with additional class III effects (potassium channel blockade), so it causes both bradycardia and QT prolongation in overdose.



**Risk of Torsades** 

- In comparison to [ECG Quiz 022](https://litfl.com/ecg-case-022/), this patient is at significant risk of TdP
- The combination of bradycardia and significant QT prolongation means that this patient plots well above the “at risk” line on the QT nomogram
- Prophylaxis of TdP in this case would include correction of QT-dependent electrolytes (K, Mg, Ca) to the high-normal range and positive chronotropy (e.g. with isoprenaline) to move the patient below the at-risk line
