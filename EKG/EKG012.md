**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 



**Main Abnormalities** 

- Giant T-wave inversions in multiple leads, most prominent in V2-6
- Marked [QT prolongation](https://litfl.com/qt-interval-ecg-library/) > 600 ms



**Diagnosis** 


This ECG pattern is characteristic of [raised intracranial pressure](https://litfl.com/raised-intracranial-pressure-ecg-library/) and is classically seen in the context of **massive intracranial haemorrhage** , particularly:

- Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage
- Haemorrhagic stroke


Similar ECG patterns have also been reported in patients with raised ICP due to:

- Large-territory ischaemic stroke causing cerebral oedema (e.g. MCA occlusion)
- Traumatic brain injury


The differential diagnosis for widespread T-wave inversions and QT prolongation includes myocardial ischaemia (e.g. [Wellens syndrome](https://litfl.com/wellens-syndrome-ecg-library/)) and electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. [hypokalemia](https://litfl.com/hypokalaemia-ecg-library/)). However, neither condition would cause the gigantic “cerebral T waves” seen here.
