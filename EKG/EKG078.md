# ECG Case 078


These ECGs are from a 58 yr old male reviewed in a rural setting, approximately ~2500 km from the nearest tertiary centre. He complained of intermittent atypical chest pain over a period of several weeks without any cardiac risk factors.


At the clinic serial ECGs were performed

- What do you think of the ECGs ?
- What advice would you give assuming you were the clinician at the tertiary receiving hospital who was contacted regarding this case ?

**Describe and interpret these ECGs** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 



**ECG 1** 
Rate:


- 84


Rhythm:


- Regular
- Sinus Rhythm


Axis:


- Normal (70 deg)


Intervals:


- PR – Normal (~160-200ms)
- QRS – Normal (80ms)
- QT – 340ms (QTc Bazett ~ 390 ms)


Segments:


- Slight Saddling ST segments leads II, III, aVF



**ECG 2** 


﻿Rate:

- 66


Rhythm:


- Regular
- Sinus Rhythm


Axis:


- Normal (-15 deg)


Intervals:


- PR – Normal (~180 ms)
- QRS – Normal (80ms)
- QT – 360ms (QTc Bazett ~ 360 ms)


Segments:


- Slight Saddling ST segments leads I, aVL


Additional:

- T Wave Inversion Leads III, aVF



**Initial interpretation:** 


- This ECG was interpreted as having dynamic ST change ? ACS.
- The patient was anticoagulated and transferred by air, ~2500 km, to a tertiary centre for further management.

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 



**…but let’s look again:** 

- The answer is somewhat less pathological.
- There is an axis change between the 2 ECGs which is a little odd
- Look at the complexes in leads III and you can see not only has the T wave become inverted but so has the P wave and QRS complex

- Compare leads aVL & aVF between the two ECGs and we can see these leads have been swapped

**The ECG changes are due to a [LA / LL lead reversal](https://litfl.com/ecg-limb-lead-reversal-ecg-library/)** 

- Leads aVL & aVF swap places
- Leads I & II swap places
- Lead III becomes completely inverted
- Lead aVR remains unchanged
- No change in the precordial leads
