# ECG Case 081


A 74 yr old patient presents to the ER having suffered several episodes of chest pain over the preceding 24 hours. His past medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, and ischaemic cardiac disease.


A series of ECG’s are performed on this patient.



**ECG 1** : taken on arrival to the Emergency Department with the patient pain free.

**ECG 2** : The patient then developed chest pain and the following ECG was recorded.

The episode of pain lasted only several minutes and resolved spontaneously.



**ECG 3** : taken 8 minutes after the second ECG with the patient now pain free.

**Describe and interpret the ECGs** 

**ECG ANSWER – ECG 1** 


This first ECG was taken on arrival to the Emergency Department with the patient pain free.


Rate:


- 66


Rhythm:


- Regular
- Sinus rhythm


Axis:


- Borderline LAD (~ -30 deg)


Intervals:


- PR – Normal (~180ms)
- QRS – Normal (80ms)
- QT – 400ms (QTc Bazett ~ 420 ms)


Segments:

- Minor ST depression lead III


Additional:

- T wave inversion leads II, III, aVF, V4, V5, V6
- Biphasic T wave leads aVR, V3
- Early precordial transition between V1 and V2
	- Dominant R wave V2
- Prominent T wave lead V2

**ECG ANSWER – ECG 2** 


The patient then developed chest pain and the following ECG was recorded.


﻿Rate:


- 84


Rhythm:


- Regular
- Sinus rhythm


Axis:


- Normal (~20 deg)


Intervals:


- PR – Normal (~200ms)
- QRS – Normal (80ms)
- QT – 360ms (QTc Bazett ~ 415 ms)


Segments:

- ST Elevation leads II (2mm), III (3mm), aVF (2mm), V4 (1.5mm), V5 (1mm), V6 (1mm)
- ST Depression aVR, aVL, V1, V2
	- Note horizontal ST morphology in V2


Additional:

- Pseudonormalisation of T waves leads II, III, aVF, V4, V5, V6
- Early precordial transition between V1 and V2
	- Dominant R wave V2
- Prominent T wave lead V2

**ECG ANSWER – ECG 3** 


The episode of pain lasted only several minutes and resolved spontaneously. This ECG was taken 8 minutes after the second ECG with the patient now pain free. 


Rate:


- 66


Rhythm:


- Regular
- Sinus rhythm


Axis:


- Borderline LAD (~ -30 deg)


Intervals:


- PR – Normal (~180ms)
- QRS – Normal (80ms)
- QT – 380ms (QTc Bazett ~ 410 ms)


Segments:

- ST elevation leads III, aVF
	- Reduced compered with ECG 2


Additional:

- T wave inversion leads II, III, aVF, V4, V5, V6
- Early precordial transition between V1 and V2
	- Dominant R wave V2
- Prominent T wave lead V2

**INTERPRETATION** 


ECG series showing ischaemia with re-perfusion (ECG 1), subsequent re-occlusion (ECG 2) with infero-postero-lateral STEMI, and spontaneous re-perfusion (ECG 3).

**OUTCOME** 


The patient was immediately discussed with cardiology services. Treated with aspirin, clopidogrel, and placed on a heparin infusion and admitted to CCU. The patient remained pain free, troponin peaked at 12 hours, 4.8 (normal <0.05), and the patient was transfer the next day for angiography. 


The angio showed:

- Right coronary: 98% stenosis –> stented
- Circumflex: 80% stenosis
- Left anterior descending: 80% proximal stenosis
- Left main: 20% proximal stenosis
- Left ventricle: Inferior hypokinesis with normal LV function
