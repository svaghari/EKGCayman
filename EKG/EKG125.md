# ECG Case 125


A 48-year-old woman is brought to triage by her daughter. She has been nauseous for the past few hours and in the past 60 minutes has developed crushing central chest pressure.

Past history includes hypertension and reflux. HR 66, BP 177/62, SpO2 99% RA.

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 

- Normal sinus rhythm, rate 66
- Normal axis
- Borderline [intraventricular conduction delay](https://litfl.com/intraventricular-conduction-delay-qrs-widening/), QRS ~100ms
- ST elevation in V3-4, with associated hyperacute T waves (HATW) that are broad and peaked in nature
- Inferior HATW best visualised in lead II (remember, it is the ratio of T wave amplitude to the preceding complex that is more significant than the overall T wave size). There is straightening of the ST segment in lead III, leading to widened T waves with an increased AUC


In the context of such a concerning history, these changes are highly suggestive of **[occlusion myocardial infarction](https://litfl.com/omi-replacing-the-stemi-misnomer/)**  secondary to a lesion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Here, an ST vector directed anterior and inferiorly is consistent with apical ischaemia, which generally occurs in the early phase of anterior MI, especially when the LAD is occluded after S1 but before D1.


Although not performed here, these authors would use [bedside echo](https://litfl.com/ecg-case-122/) to look for associated anterior regional wall motion abnormalities to further confirm the diagnosis and guide cath lab activation.


In this case, serial ECGs were performed to look for dynamics changes:

**t + 15 minutes**

- There is evolution of T wave changes, now more prominent in V4-5 with associated widening

**t + 30 minutes** 
![](https://litfl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ECG-Case-125-3.png)

- ST elevation in V3-5 has markedly progressed, now meeting “STEMI criteria”
- There is also evolving ST elevation inferiorly, with straightening of the ST segment in aVF causing a “bulky” appearance to T waves (see discussion)
- At this stage the cath lab was activated

**t + 45 minutes**

**OUTCOME** 


Following the last ECG, the patient underwent emergent angiography demonstrating a 100% proximal LAD occlusion with subsequent PCI.


The ECG below was taken on discharge one week later:

**What is your interpretation?** 


There are changes typical of evolved myocardial infarction:

- [Poor R wave progression](https://litfl.com/poor-r-wave-progression-prwp-ecg-library/) throughout the precordial leads
- [Q wave](https://litfl.com/q-wave-ecg-library/) formation in inferior and precordial leads
- ST elevation in V2-5 with a T wave:QRS ratio < 0.36, typical of [left ventricular aneurysm](https://litfl.com/left-ventricular-aneursym-ecg-library/) morphology


Although termed “aneurysm” morphology, this persisting ST elevation is more frequently associated with dyskinesia.

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 
Absence of reciprocal changes does not mean absence of occlusion


In proximal occlusions such as this case, myocardial infarct territory can be so extensive that no reciprocal ST depression is seen. The absence of such reciprocal changes, and the presence of “widespread” ST elevation, can mask the diagnosis and lead to the ECG being mislabelled as [benign early repolarisation](https://litfl.com/benign-early-repolarisation-ecg-library/) (BER).
“Small” HATW: Proportion and area matters more than height


Despite long-standing recognition that hyperacute T waves (HATW) are usually the earliest ECG manifestation of occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI), there is still no formal, universal definition of what represents a HATW. 


It is however recognised that the ratio of T wave amplitude to the preceding complex is of more significance than overall T wave size. As is the case in bundle branch block with “appropriate discordance”, abnormal depolarisation should be followed by abnormal repolarisation. This extends to the context of a low amplitude QRS complex, which should be followed by a relatively low voltage T wave. In addition, the area under the curve (AUC) of the T wave appears more relevant than the overall height. HATWs are wider and generally more symmetric than normal T-waves, and with evolving infarction the ST segment straightens and increases the AUC. 


In the right clinical scenario, we believe that HATWs alone are enough to guide a decision regarding reperfusion therapy. However, if there is uncertainty, serial ECGs should be performed as these changes generally precede classic STE findings or resolve if there is spontaneous reperfusion.


Note: although HATWs are a frequently observed “first sign” of OMI, these changes often persist during ongoing infarction (as is the case above) and their presence does not necessarily signify recent onset. We may lose a substantial amount of myocardium if we continue to wait for evolving changes that meet “STEMI” criteria.
Subtle anterior STEMI calculator


The 4-variable [subtle anterior STEMI calculator](https://www.mdcalc.com/subtle-anterior-stemi-calculator-4-variable) can be used to differentiate subtle ST‐segment elevation due to anterior myocardial infarction (usually due to LAD occlusion) from that due to BER. A simplified version of the formula uses the following four variables:
