**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 


Rate:

- 96 bpm


Rhythm:

- Regular
- Sinus rhythm


Axis:

- Normal


Intervals:

- PR – Normal (~180ms)
- QRS – Normal (80ms)
- QT – 500-520ms (QTc Bazett 630-660 ms) Measured in lead II


Additional:

- ST depression in leads II, III, aVF, V4-6
- Prominent U waves in leads V3-5
- Occur just before the p wave
- T-U fusion in all other leads



**Interpretation:** 

- Marked QT Prolongation
	- Features supportive of hypokalaemia / hypomagnesaemia
	- U waves T-U fusion
	- Variable QT measurement lead II vs lead V3 (end of T wave more easily identifiable)
- Potential contribution from [sotalol](https://litfl.com/sotalol/) – known QTc prolonging agent

**CLINICAL OUTCOME** 


Shortly after this ECG was performed the patient became unresponsive with the following ECG rhythm strip.

The rhythm strip shows sinus rhythm with several PVC’s with resultant R-on-T phenomenon and degeneration into polymorphic VT. This episode of brief and self-terminated.


Bloods revealed several metabolic alkalosis, hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia.


The patient was admitted to a critical care area for monitoring and correction of electrolyte / acid-base disturbance. In addition her sotalol was ceased due to its associated risk of QTc prolongation and she was commenced on metoprolol.
