**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 


On first glance this would appear to be [SVT](https://litfl.com/supraventricular-tachycardia-svt-ecg-library/) with [LBBB](https://litfl.com/left-bundle-branch-block-lbbb-ecg-library/) as there is:

- Regular broad-complex tachycardia.
- No atrial activity seen.
- Typical LBBB morphology in aVR, V1 and V6.
- No obvious diagnostic features for VT — compare this with [ECG 047](https://litfl.com/ecg-case-047/).


However, there is **one feature**  here that is unusual for LBBB, can you spot it?

**Reveal answer** 


There is an [rightward / inferior axis](https://litfl.com/right-axis-deviation-rad-ecg-library/) (around +90 degree)., which is atypical for Left Bundle branch block. LBBB normally has a [leftward axis](https://litfl.com/left-axis-deviation-lad-ecg-library/).


This combination of…

- Broad complex tachycardia with typical LBBB morphology.
- Inferior axis (+90 degrees).


… is suggestive of a specific type of VT known as [right ventricular outflow-tract tachycardia](https://litfl.com/right-ventricular-outflow-tract-rvot-tachycardia/) (RVOT).


RVOT is a relatively common form of right ventricular VT, occurring in two main groups:

- Patients with structurally normal hearts (= 70% of idiopathic VT).
- Patients with [arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy](https://litfl.com/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-arvc/).


It may be very difficult to differentiate RVOT from SVT with LBBB.


[NB. Left bundle branch block morphology simply indicates that the heart is depolarising from right to left. Hence, similar QRS patterns are seen with [LBBB](https://litfl.com/left-bundle-branch-block-lbbb-ecg-library/), [RVOT](https://litfl.com/right-ventricular-outflow-tract-rvot-tachycardia/) and [RV-pacing](https://litfl.com/pacemaker-rhythms-normal-patterns/)]

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 



**Tips for Spotting RVOT** 

- Suspect RVOT when you see LBBB morphology + inferior axis.
- Record a long rhythm strip looking for fusion and capture beats.


I have diagnosed this only a couple of times in the past. Each time I
had to stand by the monitor with my finger on the “print” button
waiting for a fusion or capture beat to appear before anyone would
believe me!
