**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 



**Initial 3 Complexes** 

- Rate: ~65-68
- Rhythm: Regular
- Axis: Normal


Intervals:

- PR – Normal (~160ms)
- QRS – Normal (100ms)
- QT – 400ms (QTc Bazette ~420-430 ms)


Segments:

- ST Depression I, II, III


Additional:

- P Wave Inversion Lead I


Interpretation:

- Ectopic Atrial Rhythm with ischaemic features



**Subsequent ECG** 

- Ventricular ectopic with ‘R-onT’ phenomenon
- Polymorphic VT –> VF


Interpretation:

- Acute myocardial ischaemia / infarction causing polymorphic VT / VF

**OUTCOME** 



**What happened next ?** 

- CPR
- Received 4 x 200J shocks
- 150mg iv amiodarone
- 100 mg iv lignocaine


Subsequent ROSC was achieved after < 10 minutes. Post ROSC ECG showed anterolateral ST elevation.The patient underwent inter-hospital transfer for PCI.PCI revealed a proximal LAD lesion with 90% occlusion, which was stented. 


Echo showed: 

- Normal LV size with anterior, septal and apical akinesis and overall moderate systolic impairment
- Probable LV apical thrombus
- Normal right ventricular size and apical akinesis and overall mild systolic impairment.


The patient was subsequently discharged on warfarin, anti-platelet therapy, ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, and a statin.

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 



**Things to think about** 

- The role of early revascularisation with thrombolysis prior to inter-hospital transfer
- The role of lignocaine/lidocaine in shock refractory VT/VF
- Several International Guidelines on ALS are linked to below and the recommendations on the use of lignocaine vary between guidelines
