# ECG Case 133


A 65-year-old woman presents with one hour of central chest pain following three days of exertional dyspnoea and lethargy. BP 79/51, HR 105 reg, SpO2 93 RA

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 

- Normal sinus rhythm, rate 100 bpm
- [Right bundle branch block](https://litfl.com/right-bundle-branch-block-rbbb-ecg-library/)
- Widespread ST depression, most notable in leads II and V4-6. Even in the context of RBBB, ST depression in V2-3 is excessively discordant
- ST elevation in aVR ~1mm


This ECG pattern simply represents **diffuse subendocardial ischaemia due to oxygen supply-demand mismatch** . It is the same ECG seen in patients that have a positive stress test. Note that ST elevation in aVR here is a reciprocal change to ST depression most marked in leads I, II and V4-6.


Some common clinical causes of this include:

- Hypotension or hypoxia
- Left main coronary artery (LMCA) or left anterior descending artery (LAD) stenosis/insufficiency
- Severe triple vessel disease
- ROSC post cardiac arrest


In the absence of ST elevation in other leads, acute coronary occlusion is rarely the cause of this ECG pattern.
