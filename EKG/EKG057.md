**Main Abnormalities** 



**** This is a fascinating ECG with multiple abnormalities:

- The first half of the tracing shows a [ventricular paced rhythm](https://litfl.com/pacemaker-rhythms-normal-patterns/) with positive [Sgarbossa criteria](https://litfl.com/sgarbossa-criteria-ecg-library/) indicating superimposed [inferior STEMI](https://litfl.com/inferior-stemi-ecg-library/).
- There is [excessively discordant ST elevation](https://litfl.com/sgarbossa-criteria-ecg-library/) (> 25% of Q/S wave depth) in II, III and aVF with reciprocal change in I and aVL.
- A ventricular ectopic (beat #8) occurs at a vulnerable time, resulting in a run of [ventricular flutter](https://litfl.com/ventricular-flutter-ecg-library/) (very rapid VT at rates > 200-300 bpm).
- This rapidly degenerates to [ventricular fibrillation](https://litfl.com/ventricular-fibrillation-vf-ecg-library/) (seen in the rhythm strip, which is recorded after the other 12 leads).
- The artefact at the start of the rhythm strip may represent a precordial thump!




**CLINICAL PEARLS** 


While most rhythm strips are recorded simultaneously with the 12-lead ECG, some older machines may record the rhythm strip after the other 12 leads.


Consider this as a possibility if your rhythm strip doesn’t seem to “line up” with the rest of the ECG.
