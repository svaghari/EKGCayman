# ECG Case 005


The following sequence of ECGs is taken from a middle-aged patient presenting with chest pain and diaphoresis. Can you interpret each ECG tracing in the context of the patient’s symptoms?



**ECG 5a – Chest pain and diaphoresis (time = zero)**

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 


This ECG demonstrates an evolving [anterolateral STEMI](https://litfl.com/anterior-myocardial-infarction-ecg-library/):

- ST elevation in V2-5 and aVL
- Reciprocal ST depression in III and aVF
- Pathological Q waves in V2-3
- Hyperacute T waves in V2-4 and I



**ECG 5b – Resolution of chest pain (t+20 mins)**

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 


There is transient improvement in the ST changes, with development of biphasic T waves in V2-3.


This pattern of T wave changes in V2-3 is known as [Wellens syndrome](https://litfl.com/wellens-syndrome-ecg-library/) and indicates reperfusion of a previously occluded LAD artery.


The implication of this ECG pattern is that there is an underlying critical LAD stenosis that requires emergent reperfusion, ideally via percutaneous coronary intervention.



**ECG 5c – Recurrence of chest pain (t+25 mins)**

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 


The previously biphasic T waves are now upright again — this phenomenon is referred to as [pseudonormalisation](https://hqmeded-ecg.blogspot.com.au/2014/03/pseudonormalization.html) and is a marker of re-occlusion of the culprit artery.


Despite temporary restoration of blood flow in ECG 5b, the patient is now re-infarcting!



**ECG 5d – Ongoing chest pain and diaphoresis (t+35 mins)** 
![](https://litfl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/TOP-100-ECG-QUIZ-LITFL-005-4.jpg)

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 


This ECG demonstrates a frank [anterolateral STEMI](https://litfl.com/anterior-myocardial-infarction-ecg-library/) with evolving ST changes.


This patient had a VF arrest shortly after this ECG was taken, was placed on a mechanical CPR device and taken immediately to the cath lab where she was found to have a 100% proximal LAD occlusion. She was stented, successfully cardioverted and made a good neurological recovery.

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 


There are two patterns of T-wave abnormality seen in Wellens syndrome:

- **Type A**  – Biphasic, with initial positivity and terminal negativity (25% of cases)
- **Type B**  – Deeply and symmetrically inverted (75% of cases)


These changes evolve with time after reperfusion. The type A pattern is most commonly seen in patients with spontaneous reperfusion of an occluded LAD, as was the case above.
