# ECG Case 113


65 year old male who was brought to the Emergency Department following an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. ROSC was achieved prehospital following an episode of VT. 


On arrival GCS 3, intubated with sats 98%, BP 75 systolic.

**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 


Rate:

- ~84 bpm


Rhythm:

- Regular


Axis:

- RAD


Intervals:

- PR – Prolonged(~220ms)
- QRS – Normal (80-100ms)
- QT – 400ms (QTc Bazette 470-480 ms)


Segments:

- ST Elevation leads II, III, aVF, V4, V6
	- Unusual ST morphology in inferior leads
- ST depression lead aVL, V1-3


Additional:

- Note complete lead inversion leads I, aVL – negative P/QRS/T



**Interpretation:** 

- STEMI
- Lead malposition
	- Likely V4 & V5 reversed
	- RA / LA limb lead reversal resultant inversion lead I, II/III switched and aVR/aVL switched

**CLINICAL OUTCOME** 



**What happened?** 


The patient was taken for urgent PCI which was normal!


He subsequently went on to have a CT brain which showed an extensive subarachnoid haemorrhage.


There are a number of cases in the literature where subarachnoid haemorrhage has been associated with significant ST changes:
