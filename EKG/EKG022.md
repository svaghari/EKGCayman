**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 



**Main Abnormalities** 


This ECG displays the characteristic electrocardiographic features of [quetiapine toxicity](https://litfl.com/quetiapine-toxicity-ecg-library/):

- [Sinus tachycardia](https://litfl.com/sinus-tachycardia-ecg-library/) due to anticholinergic effects
- [Prolonged QT interval](https://litfl.com/qt-interval-ecg-library/) (QT interval > half the RR interval; QTc = 560ms)


A similar pattern would be seen with other atypical antipsychotic agents such as olanzapine or clozapine.



**Significance of QT prolongation** 

- QT prolongation is a common source of concern in patients with antipsychotic toxicity, because of the theoretical risk of [Torsades de Pointes](https://litfl.com/polymorphic-vt-and-torsades-de-pointes-tdp/)
- A QTc interval > 500 ms is commonly cited as a marker of increased risk of TdP
- However, tachycardia (which is almost ubiquitous in significant poisoning with quetiapine, olanzapine or clozapine) is actually protective against TdP
- For this reason, TdP rarely occurs with quetiapine toxicity

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 



**QT interval nomogram** 

- Many Australian toxicologists use the QT interval nomogram to assess risk of TdP
- The absolute QT interval is measured manually in multiple leads and the median QT interval plotted on the nomogram ([read how to do this here](https://litfl.com/qt-interval-ecg-library/))
- Plots above the line indicate significant QT prolongation and consequent risk of TdP

By my measurements, our patient has an absolute QT of ~320 ms with HR 120 so plots below the line — i.e. not at significant risk of TdP.
