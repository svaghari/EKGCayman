**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 

- The ECG shows diffuse ST elevation.
- The morphology is atypical, there is no clear anatomical predominance for a vascular territory and no obvious reciprocal changes (except the inverted leads V1 and aVR).
- This is an example of a pseudo-infarction pattern due to [raised intracranial pressure](https://litfl.com/raised-intracranial-pressure-ecg-library/).
- Compare this with [Quiz ECG 012](https://litfl.com/ecg-case-012/) (raised ICP causing giant T wave inversions).

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 



**ECG changes with elevated ICP** 


Raised ICP is associated with certain characteristic ECG changes:

- Widespread giant [T-wave inversions](https://litfl.com/t-wave-ecg-library/) (“cerebral T waves”).
- [QT prolongation](https://litfl.com/qt-interval-ecg-library/).
- Bradycardia (the Cushing reflex – indicates imminent brainstem herniation).



**Other possible ECG changes that may be seen:** 

- ST segment elevation / depression – this may mimic myocardial ischaemia or pericarditis.
- Increased [U wave](https://litfl.com/u-wave-ecg-library/) amplitude.
- Other rhythm disturbances: sinus tachycardia, junctional rhythms, premature ventricular contractions, atrial fibrillation.


In some cases, these ECG abnormalities may be associated with echocardiographic evidence of regional ventricular wall motion abnormality – so-called [neurogenic stunned myocardium](http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/118/4/397) or neurogenic stress cardiomyopathy. The presumed mechanism is massive release of catecholamines, similar to [Takutsubo syndrome](https://litfl.com/tako-tsubo-cardiomyopathy-ecg-library/).


This patient developed labile blood pressures and transient wall motion abnormalities plus these ECG changes during a sustained spike in her ICP. The ECG changes and wall motion abnormalities improved once her ICPs came under control.
