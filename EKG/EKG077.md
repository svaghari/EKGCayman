# ECG Case 077


78 yr old male presents with a 2 day history of lethargy and dizziness. He has a history of ischaemic heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and chronic renal failure. His medications include calcium-channel blocker, beta-blocker, and ACE-inhibitor.


He is conscious with systolic BP of 70.

**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 


Rate:


- ~42


Rhythm:


- Regularly irregular 
	- Complexes occurring in paired group
- Flat baseline without atrial activity


Axis:


- 1st Complex in pair
	- Normal (70 deg)
- 2nd Complex in pair
	- LAD(-45 deg)


Intervals:


- 1st Complex in pair
	- QRS – Normal (80ms)
	- QT – 520ms
- 2nd Complex in pair
	- QRS – Normal in limb leads, Prolonged V1-3 (80-120ms)
	- QT – 440ms


Segments:




- 1st Complex in pair
	- ST Depression leads II, aVF
- 2nd Complex in pair
	- Minimal ST elevation lead aVR


Additional:




- 1st Complex in pair
	- T wave inversion II, III, aVF
	- Biphasic T lead V3
- 2nd Complex in pair
	- RsR’ Morphology V1-3
	- Inverted notching terminal portion QRS II, III, aVF also positive notching aVL
		- ? Retrograde P waves ? Secondary to conduction delay



**Interpretation:** 

- Escape bigeminy
	- In setting of sinus arrest / sinus exit block
- Non-specific ST / T wave changes


Differential of causes:

- Ischaemia
- Electrolyte disturbance
- Acid-base disturbance
- Cardiotoxic drugs
- Sinus node dysfunction
- Hypothermia
	- Multifactorial combination of above

**WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?** 


Bloods showed:


- Acute on chronic renal failure
- Metabolic acidosis – pH 7.0 Bicarb 7.0
- K 6.0


Treated with isoprenaline, sodium bicarb, cessation of cardiotoxic medication, and dialysis.


Following acute episode found to have sinus pauses on telemetry necessitating pacemaker insertion.
