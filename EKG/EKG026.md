**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 


This is a very worrying ECG demonstrating massive [anterolateral STEMI](https://litfl.com/anterior-myocardial-infarction-ecg-library/) with “tombstone” morphology:

- Gross ST elevation in V1-6, I and aVL
- Early Q wave formation in aVL
- Reciprocal ST depression in inferior leads II, III and aVF


This ECG pattern is seen in proximal LAD occlusion and indicates a large territory infarction with a poor LV ejection fraction. These patients are at high likelihood of [ventricular fibrillation](https://litfl.com/ventricular-fibrillation-vf-ecg-library/) (VF), cardiogenic shock and death, and require aggressive management both pre-hospital and in the emergency department setting.

Massive ST elevation often merges with hyperacute T waves in these patterns creating the appearance of a broad QRS complex – this can be mistaken for [hyperkalaemia](https://litfl.com/hyperkalaemia-ecg-library/) or a broad complex tachycardia.


Patients with any three of these “widow maker” patterns are at extremely high risk of lethal ventricular arrhythmias.
