# ECG Case 107


86 yr old male referred by his General Practitioner with worsening renal failure. He has a history of atrial fibrillation with bradycardia for which he had a PPM inserted. His medications include metoprolol.

**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 


Rate:

- Mean ventricular rate ~24 bpm


Rhythm:

- Irregular ventricular rhythm
- No visible P waves
- Irregular pacing spikes mean rate of 43 bpm
- No evidence of capture


Axis:

- Normal


Intervals:

- QRS â€“ Prolonged


Additional:

- ST depression with T wave inversion leads II, III, aVF


Interpretation:

- Pacemaker failure to capture
- Underlying marked slow atrial fibrillation

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 



**Causes of pacemaker failures** 


In broad terms there is either a problem with the pacemaker signal generator, the connection to the patient or the patient. These can be further expanded:

- Signal generator problems
	- End-of-life
	- Battery failure
	- Programming issue
	- Over or under sensing
- Connection between unit and patient
	- Lead fracture
	- Lead malposition
	- Lead migration
	- Lead fibrosis
- Patient factors
	- Progression of underlying disease
	- Ischaemia
	- Electrolyte / acid-base disturbance
	- Drug toxicity

**CLINICAL OUTCOME** 



**What happened next?** 


The patient had moderate renal failure with a normal potassium. 


CXR showed no lead abnormality and lead placement appeared unaltered. 


His metoprolol was ceased and the pacemaker threshold was reprogrammed with resultant 100% capture.
