**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 



**Main Abnormalities** 


This ECG shows changes consistent with an old [anterolateral infarction](https://litfl.com/anterior-myocardial-infarction-ecg-library/) — the so-called [left ventricular aneurysm](https://litfl.com/left-ventricular-aneursym-ecg-library/) pattern.

- ST elevation in V1-3 associated with deep Q waves (= [LV aneurysm morphology](https://litfl.com/left-ventricular-aneursym-ecg-library/)).
- [Pathological Q waves](https://litfl.com/q-wave-ecg-library/) also seen in I, aVL and V4.
- [Poor R wave progression](https://litfl.com/poor-r-wave-progression-prwp-ecg-library/) (= R wave height < 3 mm in V3).
- Biphasic / inverted T waves in V1-5, I and aVL.

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 


The LV aneurysm pattern refers to the combination of residual ST
elevation, deep Q waves and inverted or biphasic T waves seen in
patients following an acute myocardial infarction. This ECG pattern is
associated with transmural scarring and paradoxical movement of the
LV on  wall on echocardiography.


Around 60% of patients with anterior STEMI develop some degree of
chronic ST elevation on their ECG, which can cause diagnostic confusion.


If these patients present with chest pain, the safest approach is to
take serial ECGs looking for signs of evolving STEMI such as evolving
ST elevation or [pseudo-normalisation of T waves](https://hqmeded-ecg.blogspot.com.au/search/label/pseudonormalization).
