# ECG Case 108


59yr old male who presented to the Emergency Department following 2 episodes of syncope. He had a long history of infrequent unexplained syncope over the prior 15 years. 


His only past medical history is diet controlled T2DM and he was taking no regular medications.

** NOTE this is a non-diagnostic ECG recording as it was generated retrospectively from the rhythm telemetry unit



**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 


Key features: 

- Sinus rhythm rate ~90 bpm
- Left axis deviation
- RBBB Morphology
- Prominent T waves and ST elevation in leads II, III, aVF, V2-5 with high voltage complexes
	- This ECG was generated using the monitor (non-diagnostic) algorithm. The filter applied in this mode is 0.5 to 40 Hz which can over- or under-estimate low frequency portions of the ECG including the ST segment.
	- The diagnostic algorithm filter performs at 0.05 to 150 Hz.
	- For a somewhat complicated overview of ECG filtering check out:

- Borderline 1st degree AV block



**Interpretation:** 

- [Bifascicular Block](https://litfl.com/bifascicular-block-ecg-library/)
- Borderline PR prolongation
- Requires cardiology referral for monitoring and consideration of PPM insertion given history of syncope
- ST / T wave changes without chest pain or electrolyte abnormality – related to ECG filtering algorithm

**ECG with palpitations** 


The patient complained of palpitations. Due to rate and rhythm change a rhythm strip was automatically generated

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 


Key features:

- Atrial rate 136 bpm
- Ventricular rate 27 bpm
- AV Dissociation 
- Broad Complex QRS


Impression:

- Complete heart block
- Ventricular escape rhythm

**Interpretation:** 

- Compared with rhythm strip above
- [Complete heart block](https://litfl.com/av-block-3rd-degree-complete-heart-block/)
- AV Dissociate with ventricular escape rhythm, rate 24 bpm
- Slowing of atrial rate now ~115 bpm

**CLINICAL OUTCOME** 



**What happened next?** 


The patient was treated with atropine followed by isoprenaline infusion. 


The next day he underwent an uneventful dual chamber PPM insertion. A subsequent echo showed was normal with an ejection fraction of 64%.


On review of his medical records prior ECG’s had shown alternating left and right bundle branch blocks confirming progressive conducting system disease.
