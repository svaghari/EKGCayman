**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 



**Key Abnormalities** 

- There is ST elevation in the inferior leads II, III and aVF.
- The concave morphology might lead you to suspect [pericarditis](https://litfl.com/pericarditis-ecg-library/) – however, there is reciprocal change in the high lateral leads I and aVL, confirming the diagnosis of [inferior STEMI](https://litfl.com/inferior-stemi-ecg-library/).


There are additional features suggestive of [right ventricular infarction](https://litfl.com/right-ventricular-infarction-ecg-library/):

- ST elevation in III > II
- Isoelectric ST segment in V1 with ST depression in V2



**Other Abnormalities** 

- There is a break in the rhythm towards the end of the rhythm strip, with what appears to be a non-conducted P wave, suggesting the development of [2nd degree AV block](https://litfl.com/av-block-2nd-degree-mobitz-i-wenckebach-phenomenon/) — e.g. a slowly-evolving Wenckbach cycle.
- The 13th QRS complex appears to be a supraventricular ectopic beat ([PAC](https://litfl.com/premature-atrial-complex-pac/) or [PJC](https://litfl.com/premature-junctional-complex-pjc/)).
