**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 



**Overview** 


The most striking abnormality on this ECG is [extremely low QRS voltage](https://litfl.com/low-qrs-voltage-ecg-library/), in this case due to[ severe myxoedema](https://litfl.com/hypothyroidism-ecg-library/).



**Definition** 


The QRS is said to be low voltage when:

- The amplitudes of all the QRS complexes in the limb leads are < 5 mm; **OR** 
- The amplitudes of all the QRS complexes in the precordial leads are  < 10 mm



**Mechanisms** 


Low voltage is produced by…

- The “damping” effect of increased layers of fluid, fat or air between the heart and the recording electrode.
- Loss of viable myocardium.
- Diffuse infiltration or myxoedematous involvement of the heart.



**Causes** 


Specific causes of low voltage include:

- **Fluid** : [Pericardial effusion](https://litfl.com/ecg-findings-in-massive-pericardial-effusion/); Pleural effusion **** 
- **Fat:** Obesity
- **Air** : [Emphysema](https://litfl.com/ecg-in-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/); [Pneumothorax](http://hqmeded-ecg.blogspot.com.au/2014/01/low-voltage-in-precordial-leads.html)
- **Infiltrative / Connective Tissue Disorders** : Myxoedema; infiltrative myocardial diseases — i.e.[ restrictive cardiomyopathy](https://litfl.com/restrictive-cardiomyopathy-ecg-library/) due to amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, haemochromatosis; constrictive pericarditis; and scleroderma.
- **Loss of viable myocardium** : Previous massive MI; end-stage [dilated cardiomyopathy](https://litfl.com/dilated-cardiomyopathy-dcm-ecg-library/)


Most important cause: 



**Massive pericardial effusion**  with triad of:

- Low voltage
- Tachycardia
- Electrical alternans


Patients with this triad need to be immediately assessed for clinical or echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.
