**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 



**Main Abnormalities** 

- Sinus rhythm with frequent ventricular ectopics in a pattern of [ventricular bigeminy](https://litfl.com/premature-ventricular-complex-pvc-ecg-library/).
- Grossly prolonged QT interval (> 600 ms).
- “R on T” phenomenon is present, with each VEB falling on the end of the T wave — this ECG pattern is very high risk for deterioration to [torsades de pointes](https://litfl.com/polymorphic-vt-and-torsades-de-pointes-tdp/) and [ventricular fibrillation](https://litfl.com/ventricular-fibrillation-vf-ecg-library/).
- Relatively short PR interval and possible [delta waves](https://litfl.com/delta-wave-ecg-library/) (leads I, II, V6) are suggestive — but not diagnostic — of [WPW syndrome](https://litfl.com/pre-excitation-syndromes-ecg-library/).
- Voltage criteria for [left ventricular hypertrophy](https://litfl.com/left-ventricular-hypertrophy-lvh-ecg-library/) are present in multiple leads.


This patient had suffered a cardiac arrest in the context of severe [hypertrophic cardiomyopathy](https://litfl.com/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-hcm-ecg-library/) and [long QT syndrome](https://litfl.com/qt-interval-ecg-library/).


(NB. ~1/3 of patients with HOCM will have some evidence of WPW on their ECG).

**Can you guess what happened next?** 


The patient had a further TdP cardiac arrest!


This was treated with IV magnesium and potassium, with restoration of sinus rhythm.
