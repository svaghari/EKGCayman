**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 



**This is a tricky ECG!** 


There is evidence of [atrial fibrillation](https://litfl.com/atrial-fibrillation-ecg-library/), as evidenced by the irregular baseline with fibrillatory waves most prominent in V1-2.


NB. Fibrillatory waves are characteristically seen in V1-2 (which overlie the atria), as opposed to [tremor artefact](https://litfl.com/ecg-motion-artefacts-ecg-library/) which may be in seen in multiple leads without a predominance for V1-2. 


However, the ventricular rhythm is regular. How can this be? AF is irregular by definition…


This is an example of [“regularised AF”](https://litfl.com/digoxin-toxicity-ecg-library/) due to [digoxin toxicity](https://litfl.com/digoxin-toxicity-ecg-library/):

- The underlying rhythm is AF, which is being treated with digoxin.
- There is [complete heart block](https://litfl.com/av-block-3rd-degree-complete-heart-block/), prevent atrial impulses from reaching the ventricles.
- There is an [accelerated junctional rhythm](https://litfl.com/accelerated-junctional-rhythm-ajr/) maintaining cardiac output.


If this all seems like too much of a coincidence, then consider the pathophysiology of digoxin toxicity…


**CLINICAL PEARLS** Mechanisms of Digoxin Toxicity



**Digoxin toxicity produces a wide variety of dysrhythmias, due to:** 

- **Increased automaticity**  of atrial, junctional and
ventricular tissues — via actions at the Na/K and Na/Ca exchangers
causing increased intracellular calcium and therefore increased
spontaneous depolarisation of cardiac pacemaker cells.
- **Decreased AV conduction**  — via increased vagal tone at the AV node.



**Digoxin toxicity produces some combination of:** 

- **Increased atrial automaticity**  — especially atrial tachycardia, but also [atrial ectopics](https://litfl.com/premature-atrial-complex-pac/), [AF](https://litfl.com/atrial-fibrillation-ecg-library/), [flutter](https://litfl.com/atrial-flutter-ecg-library/).
- **Increased junctional automaticity**  — especially [accelerated junctional rhythms](https://litfl.com/accelerated-junctional-rhythm-ajr/).
- **Increased ventricular automaticity**  — frequent [VEBs and bigeminy](https://litfl.com/premature-ventricular-complex-pvc-ecg-library/), [polymorphic VT](https://litfl.com/polymorphic-vt-and-torsades-de-pointes-tdp/).
- **AV blocks**  — including [1st](https://litfl.com/first-degree-heart-block-ecg-library/), [2nd](https://litfl.com/av-block-2nd-degree-mobitz-i-wenckebach-phenomenon/) and [3rd degree](https://litfl.com/av-block-3rd-degree-complete-heart-block/) AV block.



**Characteristic ECG patterns include:** 

- [Atrial tachycardia with high-grade AV block](https://litfl.com/ecg-case-030/) (= the classic dig-toxic rhythm).
- [Regularised AF](https://litfl.com/digoxin-toxicity-ecg-library/) =  AF with complete heart block + accelerated junctional escape rhythm, producing a paradoxically regular rhythm.
- [Bidirectional VT](https://litfl.com/bidirectional-ventricular-tachycardia-bvt-ecg-library/) = polymorphic VT with QRS complexes that alternate between left- and right-axis-deviation, or between LBBB and RBBB morphology.


NB. Digoxin toxicity should not be confused with [digoxin effect](https://litfl.com/digoxin-effect-ecg-library/) (= “sagging” ST depression and T-wave inversion in patients on therapeutic doses of digoxin; not predictive of toxicity). 



**Clinical Pearls** 

- Check for tremor artefact before you start diagnosing regularised AF!
- If the ECG pattern appears genuine and the clinical picture is
compatible with digoxin toxicity (GI upset, xanthopsia, current digoxin
treatment), then check an urgent digoxin level.
