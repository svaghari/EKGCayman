**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 



**Diagnosis** 


This ECG shows a regular broad complex tachycardia with an RSR’ pattern in V1.


The differential diagnosis could include:

- [Ventricular tachycardia](https://litfl.com/ventricular-tachycardia-monomorphic-ecg-library/).
- [SVT with aberrant conduction](https://litfl.com/vt-versus-svt-ecg-library/) — either due to [RBBB](https://litfl.com/right-bundle-branch-block-rbbb-ecg-library/) or [WPW](https://litfl.com/pre-excitation-syndromes-ecg-library/).


On closer inspection, the ECG demonstrates some classic features of **ventricular tachycardia** :

- [Northwest axis](https://litfl.com/ecg-axis-interpretation/) — QRS is positive in aVR, negative in I and aVF
- The **taller left rabbit ear**  sign — There is an atypical RBBB pattern in V1, where the left “rabbit ear” is taller than the right
- Negative QRS complex (R/S ratio < 1) in V6


These findings indicate VT rather than SVT with aberrancy.

- Taller left rabbit ear = **VT**

- Taller right rabbit ear = **RBBB** 

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 


Other factors that increase the likelihood of VT in patients presenting with regular broad complex tachycardia include:

- Age > 35 (positive predictive value of 85%)
- Structural heart disease — e.g. IHD, CCF, cardiomyopathy
- Family history of sudden cardiac death or arrhythmogenic conditions such as [HOCM](https://litfl.com/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-hcm-ecg-library/), [Brugada syndrome](https://litfl.com/brugada-syndrome-ecg-library/) or [ARVD](https://litfl.com/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-arvc/) that are associated with episodes of VT


In any patient with a broad complex rhythm, also consider the possibility of toxic / metabolic conditions such as [hyperkalaemia](https://litfl.com/hyperkalaemia-ecg-library/) or [sodium-channel blockade](https://litfl.com/tricyclic-overdose-sodium-channel-blocker-toxicity/).
