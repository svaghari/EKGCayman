# ECG Case 130


Thanks to Emergency Physician [Dr David McCreary](https://twitter.com/dmccreary85?lang=en) for sharing this case for discussion.


Another busy night in ED and another ECG is thrust in front of you. 



25-year-old female with ‘palpitations’. BP 117/72, GCS 15.

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 

- Regular narrow complex tachycardia, rate 132 bpm
- Slight [right axis deviation](https://litfl.com/right-axis-deviation-rad-ecg-library/)
- Dominant R wave in V1 meets voltage criteria for [right ventricular hypertrophy](https://litfl.com/right-ventricular-hypertrophy-rvh-ecg-library/) (RVH)
- Pseudo R’ waves in the terminal portion of the QRS in V1, an isoelectric baseline, and lack of flutter waves in V1 point towards this rhythm being an [AV nodal re-entry tachycardia](https://litfl.com/supraventricular-tachycardia-svt-ecg-library/) (AVNRT)
- No rate-related ischaemia


There is one other feature on this ECG that suggests this patient has a congenital structural abnormality, can you spot it?

**Reveal answer** 

- Notching near the apex of the R wave in inferior leads is known as [Crochetage sign](https://litfl.com/crochetage-sign-ecg-library/)
- The presence of this sign in all three inferior leads has a 92-100% specificity for the diagnosis of a **secundum atrial septal defect (ASD)**

**[Crochetage sign](https://litfl.com/crochetage-sign-ecg-library/):**  Notching at the apex of the R wave in inferior leads. When present in all three inferior leads, this sign is highly specific for secundum ASD


Shortly after the above ECG was taken, the patient spontaneously reverted into sinus rhythm and a repeat ECG was taken:

**What is your interpretation?** 

**Reveal answer** 

- Normal sinus rhythm, rate 84 bpm
- Multiple [premature atrial complexes](https://litfl.com/premature-atrial-complex-pac/) (PACs) — 2nd and 10th beat
- Features of secundum ASD are again seen — Crochetage sign in all three inferior leads, slight RAD and dominant R wave in V1

**OUTCOME** 


This patient self-reverted in and out of AVNRT multiple times during her stay in the emergency department. When in sinus rhythm she had frequent PACs, which reduced following the administration of metoprolol. She subsequently remained in sinus rhythm and was referred for formal TTE and evaluation for definitive repair of secundum ASD.

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 


Secundum ASD is a common sporadic congenital heart defect with a prevalence of around 1 in 800 in the general population. Patients with an isolated defect usually remain asymptomatic until the 3rd decade of life, with the most common adult presentation being supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), followed by exercise intolerance and/or fatigue. If left untreated, long term morbidity relates to the development of pulmonary hypertension.


ECG changes likely relate to functional RV volume overload due to left-to-right shunting, with resultant raised pulmonary pressures. The characteristic Crochetage sign often disappears following defect repair, which is usually via transcatheter device closure.
