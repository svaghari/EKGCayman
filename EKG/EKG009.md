**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 


This ECG is an example of [hyperacute anterolateral STEMI](https://litfl.com/anterior-myocardial-infarction-ecg-library/):

- There are markedly peaked, asymmetrical T waves ([= hyperacute T waves](https://litfl.com/t-wave-ecg-library/)) in V2-5
- The associated loss of R wave height (analogous to early Q wave formation) causes the enlarging precordial T waves to tower over the diminishing R waves
- There is also some subtle ST elevation in aVL, indicating [LAD occlusion proximal to the D1](https://litfl.com/anterior-myocardial-infarction-ecg-library/)
- There are frequent [ventricular ectopic beats](https://litfl.com/premature-ventricular-complex-pvc-ecg-library/), which are concerning in this context as they suggest underlying myocardial irritability and a risk of deterioration to malignant ventricular dysrhythmias such as [VF](https://litfl.com/ventricular-fibrillation-vf-ecg-library/) or [VT](https://litfl.com/ventricular-tachycardia-monomorphic-ecg-library/)

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 


Serial ECGs of this patient showed evolving anterolateral ST elevation (V1-6, I, aVL) with development of inferior reciprocal change (lead III).
