**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 



**Main Abnormalities** 

- Widespread ST depression affecting multiple precordial (V2-6) and limb leads (esp. I, II, avF).
- To some extent this is masked by an indistinct J point, upsloping (rather than horizontal) ST depression, and some baseline wander of the ECG
- There is marked ST elevation in aVR, measuring ~3mm

- ST depression in aVF relative to the T-P baseline. **** 
- The blue arrow denotes the approximate position of the J point.

- ST elevation in aVR**** 



**Diagnosis** 


In the context of ischaemic chest pain and cardiogenic shock, the combination of…

- Widespread ST depression
- Marked ST elevation in aVR > 1 mm
- ST elevation in aVR > V1


… is extremely concerning for severe [left main coronary artery (LMCA) insufficiency](https://litfl.com/lmca-occlusion-st-elevation-in-avr/).



**However, this pattern is not entirely specific for LMCA insufficiency.**  It may be seen whenever there is severe diffuse subendocardial ischaemia, as a result of oxygen supply-demand mismatch:

- Severe triple vessel disease
- Severe anaemia or hypoxaemia
- Following resuscitation from cardiac arrest


This patient developed progressive cardiogenic shock complicated by runs of [ventricular tachycardia](https://litfl.com/ventricular-tachycardia-monomorphic-ecg-library/). He was taken for immediate angiography where he was found to have a 99% stenosis of his left main coronary artery. 

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 


A similar ECG pattern of diffuse ST depression with ST elevation in aVR may also be seen with [supraventricular tachycardias](https://litfl.com/supraventricular-tachycardia-svt-ecg-library/) ([AVNRT](https://litfl.com/supraventricular-tachycardia-svt-ecg-library/) / [atrial flutter](https://litfl.com/atrial-flutter-ecg-library/)). 


This **rate-related change**  is usually benign and resolves with resolution of the SVT.
