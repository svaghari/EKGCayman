**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 


On first glance this ECG could easily be mistaken for an example of [Mobitz II AV block](https://litfl.com/av-block-2nd-degree-mobitz-ii-hay-block/) — there are intermittent non-conducted P waves with a constant PR interval. However, regular [pacing spikes](https://litfl.com/pacemaker-rhythms-normal-patterns/) can be seen following the P waves in leads V3-6.


This is an example of [pacemaker malfunction](https://litfl.com/pacemaker-malfunction-ecg-library/), with intermittent **failure to capture** :

- Regular P waves are seen at ~65 bpm
- Each P wave is following by a pacing spike (best seen in V3-6, subtle pacing spikes also present in I, aVR, V1). This indicates that [atrial sensing](https://litfl.com/pacemaker-rhythms-normal-patterns/) is intact. NB. Pacing spikes will typically not be seen in all 12 leads
- Some of the pacing spikes are followed by typical [ventricular-paced](https://litfl.com/pacemaker-rhythms-normal-patterns/) complexes. The [LBBB morphology](https://litfl.com/left-bundle-branch-block-lbbb-ecg-library/) indicates that the pacing lead is in the right ventricle — the heart depolarises from right to left in the same way as LBBB. Also note the [negative concordance](https://litfl.com/vt-versus-svt-ecg-library/) in V1-6 (all QRS complexes are negative). This is often quoted as a feature of [ventricular tachycardia](https://litfl.com/ventricular-tachycardia-monomorphic-ecg-library/), but simply indicates that the rhythm is arising from the anterior surface of the right ventricle — the heart is depolarising away from the V1-6 electrodes
- Several of the P waves / pacing spikes are not followed by QRS complexes, producing a ventricular rate of ~ 40 bpm
- Quite worryingly, there does not seem to be any native ventricular activity kicking in when the heart rate drops. The second half of the rhythm strip shows two sequential non-conducted P waves with no evidence of any [escape rhythm](https://litfl.com/ventricular-escape-rhythm-ecg-library/). This suggests the presence of underlying [complete heart block](https://litfl.com/av-block-3rd-degree-complete-heart-block/) with inadequate escape mechanisms and significant risk of ventricular standstill

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 



**Failure to Capture** 


The problem here is failure of the pacemaker to “capture” (depolarise) the ventricular myocardium. Causes of this include:

- Pacemaker lead fracture or migration (e.g. due to [Twiddler’s syndrome](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200304243481722))
- Refractory myocardium — due to electrolyte abnormality (esp. [hyperkalaemia](https://litfl.com/hyperkalaemia-ecg-library/)) or [myocardial ischaemia](https://litfl.com/myocardial-ischaemia-ecg-library/)
