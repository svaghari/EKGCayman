**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 



**Main Abnormalities** 


This ECG demonstrates the typical features of [dextrocardia](https://litfl.com/dextrocardia-ecg-library/):

- Marked [right axis deviation](https://litfl.com/right-axis-deviation-rad-ecg-library/) (+180 degrees)
- Lead aVR: Positive QRS complex (upright P and T waves)
- Lead I: inversion of all complexes, aka ‘global negativity’ (inverted P-QRS-T)
- Absent R-wave progression in the chest leads (dominant S waves throughout)



**Differential Diagnosis** 


Accidental [reversal of the left and right arm electrodes](https://litfl.com/lead-reversal-left-arm-right-arm-ecg-library/) may produce a similar picture to dextrocardia in the limb leads, but with normal appearances in the precordial leads.
