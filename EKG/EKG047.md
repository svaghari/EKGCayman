**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 


This is another example of [ventricular tachycardia](https://litfl.com/ventricular-tachycardia-monomorphic-ecg-library/), this time with a dominant S wave in V1/V2 and therefore a LBBB morphology (compare this with [ECG 046](https://litfl.com/ecg-case-046/)).


Regular broad complex tachycardia at ~ 160 bpm.


[Features of VT in V1](https://litfl.com/vt-versus-svt-ecg-library/):

- Initial R wave > 30 ms wide, RS interval > 70 ms (Brugada sign)
- Notching/slurring of the downslope of the S wave in V1/V2 (Josephson sign).


 [Features of VT in V6](https://litfl.com/vt-versus-svt-ecg-library/): 

- Dominant S wave in V6; qR wave; absence of typical LBBB morphology
- Abnormal axis with positive aVR, although does not quite meet criteria for [northwest axis](https://litfl.com/ecg-axis-interpretation/).


NB. Note that a positive Brugada sign only requires an RS interval of >60 ms when LBBB morphology is present, compared to >100 ms when RBBB morphology is present.

Dominant S Wave in V1 or V2 (LBBB Morphology)



**Lead V1 or V2**

**Lead V6**

These features are very different to the expected pattern in [LBBB](https://litfl.com/left-bundle-branch-block-lbbb-ecg-library/), which has:

- Dominant S wave in V1, but with an R/S interval < 70 ms and minimal initial R wave.
- Dominant R wave in V6 (often slurred).

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 



**Tips for Spotting VT when LBBB morphology present** 


[NB. LBBB morphology = QRS > 120ms with dominant S wave in V1]


Suspect VT in any patient with a regular broad complex tachycardia (esp if > 160 ms wide).

**Look at aVR** 

- Positive QRS complex?
- Leads I and aVF negative?
- If yes to both -> [northwest axis](https://litfl.com/ecg-axis-interpretation/) is present -> probable VT.

**Look at V1** 

- Initial R wave > 30 ms? –> probable VT.
- Notching of the S wave (Josephson’s sign)? –> probable VT.
- RS interval > 70 ms (Brugada’s sign)? –> probable VT.
- None of the above –> possible SVT with LBBB.

**Look at V6** 

- Dominant S wave (R/S ratio < 1)? -> probable VT.
- Dominant R wave (R/S ratio > 1)?-> possible SVT with LBBB.


If still uncertain, scrutinise the ECG for:

- AV dissociation — P waves randomly deforming the QRS complexes and T waves.
- [Fusion and capture beats.](https://litfl.com/vt-versus-svt-ecg-library/)

**If still uncertain…review the ECG for:** 

- AV dissociation — P waves randomly deforming the QRS complexes and T waves
- [Fusion and capture beats.](https://litfl.com/vt-versus-svt-ecg-library/)

AV dissociation: superimposed P waves at a different rate to the QRS complexes

The first of the narrower complexes is a fusion beat, the next two are capture beats.
