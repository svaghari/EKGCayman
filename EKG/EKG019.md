**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 



**Main Abnormalities** 

- ST depression in V2-5, which slopes upwards and joins the ascending limb of the T wave
- Prominent, “rocket-shaped” T waves in the precordial leads V2-5
- Subtle ST elevation in aVR



**Diagnosis** 

- This combination of ST depression with rocket-shaped T waves in the precordial leads V1-6 is referred to as the De Winter ECG pattern or [“De Winter T waves”](https://litfl.com/de-winter-t-wave-ecg-library/)
- It is now recognised as an anterior STEMI equivalent (~2% of LAD occlusions), and should be treated identically to anterior STEMI, with urgent PCI or thrombolysis

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 


The De Winter ECG pattern may evolve into (or even evolve from) a more classic STEMI pattern.
