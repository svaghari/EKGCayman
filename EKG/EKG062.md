**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 



**Main Abnormalities** 

- ST depression in V2-6, which slopes upwards and joins the ascending limb of the T wave.
- Prominent, “rocket-shaped” T waves in the precordial leads V2-5.
- Subtle ST elevation in aVR.



**Diagnosis** 

- This combination of ST depression with rocket-shaped T waves in the precordial leads V1-6 is referred to as the De Winter ECG pattern or [“De Winter’s T waves”](hhttps://litfl.com/de-winter-t-wave-ecg-library/) (also see [ECG 019](https://litfl.com/ecg-case-019/))
- It is becoming increasingly recognised as an anterior STEMI equivalent (~2% of LAD occlusions).
- [Some authors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24176590) are now recommending that this ECG pattern be treated identically to anterior STEMI, with urgent PCI or thrombolysis.
