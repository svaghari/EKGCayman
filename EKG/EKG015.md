**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 


This is the same patient from [ECG 014](https://litfl.com/ecg-case-014/)


Posterior leads confirm the presence of posterior wall infarction by demonstrating typical STEMI morphology:

- ST elevation in V7-9
- Q waves in V7-9
- Inversion of the terminal portion of the T wave (“[U wave inversion](https://litfl.com/u-wave-ecg-library/)“) in V7-9

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 



**How To Record Posterior Leads** 


Simply move the V4-6 electrodes around to the back in the same horizontal plane as V6. Annotate the ECG accordingly.


Approximate positions for V7-9 are:

- V7 – left posterior axillary line
- V8 – tip of left scapula
- V9 – left paraspinal region
