# ECG Case 115


The following ECG is from a 71yr old male who presented with several episodes of ischaemic sounding chest pain on a background of known ischaemic cardiac disease.

**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 


Rate:

- Mean rate 66 bpm


Rhythm:

- Sinus rhythm
- Unifocal PVCs


Axis:

- Normal


Intervals:

- PR – Normal (~200ms)
- QRS – Prolonged (120-130 ms)
- QT – 410ms (QTc Bazett 470 ms)


Additional:

- QRS fragmentation 
	- Best seen leads V2-3
	- Lead V2 rsr’s’r”s” pattern
	- Lead V3 rsr’s’ pattern
- T wave inversion leads V4-5
- ST elevation leads aVR and aVL (< 1mm)<1mm font=””>
- ST depression leads II, III, aVF



**Interpretation:** 

- ST and T wave changes
	- Likely ACS given history 
	- Needs serial ECGs and comparison with prior ECGs
- QRS Fragmentation
	- Caused by abnormal ventricular repolarisation
	- Due to myocardial scarring, fibrosis or ischaemia

**CLINICAL OUTCOME** 



**QRS Fragmentation** 


The two following papers are a great overview of QRS fragmentation including diagnostic morphology and clinical relevance in terms of associations and effects on morbidity and mortality.
