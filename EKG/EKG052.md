**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 


This is classic ECG of [Wellens syndrome](https://litfl.com/wellens-syndrome-ecg-library/) (Pattern A),  demonstrating characteristic biphasic T waves in V1-3.

- This ECG pattern is highly predictive of a significant occlusive lesion of the LAD.
- The biphasic T waves are a marker of reperfusion and may occur after an aborted [anterior STEMI](https://litfl.com/anterior-myocardial-infarction-ecg-library/).
- Despite often being pain free and having normal cardiac enzymes at presentation, these patients are at risk of sudden LAD re-occlusion leading to massive anterior STEMI and are best managed with early angiography and PCI / CABG.

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 



**Biphasic T waves**  may be seen with both [Wellens syndrome](https://litfl.com/wellens-syndrome-ecg-library/) and [hypokalaemia](https://litfl.com/hypokalaemia-ecg-library/).


The main differentiating factor (apart from the clinical picture) is the direction of the T waves:

- Wellens’ biphasic T waves go UP then down.
- Hypokalaemic T waves go DOWN then up**.**
