**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 



**Main Abnormalities** 

- Sinus tachycardia ~ 100 bpm
- Anterior T wave abnormalities: inverted in V1-4
- Inferior T wave abnormalities: inverted in III, aVF
- Subtle ST elevation in III and aVF, without reciprocal changes



**Significance of ECG Findings** 


This pattern of T wave inversions in the right precordial leads V1-4 plus the inferior leads (especially the rightward-facing lead III) is referred to as the [right ventricular strain pattern](https://litfl.com/right-ventricular-strain-ecg-library/). It is a marker of [right ventricular hypertrophy](https://litfl.com/right-ventricular-hypertrophy-rvh-ecg-library/) or dilatation.



**Diagnosis** 


In a patient presenting with acute shortness of breath, the combination of…

- Sinus tachycardia
- RV strain pattern in V1-4 (+/- lead III)


… is highly suggestive of acute cor pulmonale due to massive [pulmonary embolism](https://litfl.com/ecg-changes-in-pulmonary-embolism/).


However, these ECG changes are not specific to PE and may be seen in other conditions associated with pulmonary hypertension and RV enlargement including:

- [Chronic lung disease](https://litfl.com/ecg-in-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/) (COPD, lung fibrosis) with chronic cor pulmonale
- [Right ventricular hypertropy](https://litfl.com/right-ventricular-hypertrophy-rvh-ecg-library/) — e.g. due to congenital causes, valvular heart disease
- [Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy](https://litfl.com/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-arvc/)

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 


Anterior T-wave inversion in V1-3 is also seen in [Wellens syndrome](https://litfl.com/wellens-syndrome-ecg-library/). The presence of concurrent inferior T-wave inversion, especially in leads facing the right ventricle (III), is highly specific for differentiating pulmonary embolism from Wellens syndrome. For another example of this pattern, see [ECG Case 123](https://litfl.com/ecg-case-123/).


Other ECG findings associated with pulmonary embolism include:

- New [right axis deviation](https://litfl.com/right-axis-deviation-rad-ecg-library/)
- New [right bundle branch block](https://litfl.com/right-bundle-branch-block-rbbb-ecg-library/)
- New [dominant R wave in V1](https://litfl.com/r-wave-ecg-library/)
- Non-specific ST segment changes


The often quoted SI QIII TIII  pattern (deep S wave in lead I, Q wave in III, inverted T wave in III) is neither sensitive nor specific for PE and is infrequently seen (20% of cases).


Similarly, sinus tachycardia is not as ubiquitous in PE as people seem to think (< 50% of cases), and certainly should not be relied up to exclude PE.
