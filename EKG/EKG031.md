**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 



**Main Abnormalities** 

- The first half of the ECG shows sinus rhythm with [prominent U waves](https://litfl.com/u-wave-ecg-library/) and a [long QU interval](https://litfl.com/qt-interval-ecg-library/) (520ms).
- An [atrial ectopic beat](https://litfl.com/premature-atrial-complex-pac/) kicks off a run of [Torsades de Pointes](https://litfl.com/polymorphic-vt-and-torsades-de-pointes-tdp/) by landing on the T/U wave during the vulnerable phase of repolarisation and causing “R on T” (or “R on U”) phenomenon.

**Diagnosis** 


The combination of…

- Atrial ectopy
- Prominent U waves
- Long QU interval
- Torsades de Pointes


… is strongly suggestive of [severe hypokalaemia](https://litfl.com/hypokalaemia-ecg-library/). This patient had a K of 1.9 mmol/L.


Hypokalaemia occurs in eating disorders via multiple mechanisms including:

- H+ is lost in vomiting — renal distal tubular reabsorption of H+ occurs in exchange for K+ (primary mechanism)
- Loss of K+ in bodily secretions — vomiting, purging with laxatives or diuretics
- Reduced oral intake
- Metabolic alkalosis from vomiting causing intracellular shifts of K+
- Hypovolaemia causing secondary aldosteronism with renal loss of K+

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 



**U wave morphology** 


The appearance of U waves in [hypokalemia](https://litfl.com/hypokalaemia-ecg-library/) may vary. This example demonstrates discrete U waves that are clearly distinguishable from the T wave.


Compare this with [Quiz ECG 006](https://litfl.com/ecg-case-006/), where the whole ST-T-U complex is fused together to produce a “rollercoaster” appearance, with the U wave appearing as a positive deflection that emerges from a negative ST segment and T wave.
