**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 



**Top rhythm strip** 

- Regular narrow complex tachycardia
- Pseudo-R’ waves ([retrograde P waves](https://litfl.com/p-wave-ecg-library/)) are seen deforming the J point



**Middle rhythm strip** 

- 12mg adenosine given
- A salvo of broad and bizarre-looking complexes interrupts the rhythm (this is a common phenomenon during chemical cardioversion with adenosine)



**Bottom rhythm strip** 

- The patient has reverted to sinus rhythm
- The pseudo-R’ waves have now disappeared
- There are no obvious [delta waves](https://litfl.com/delta-wave-ecg-library/) of WPW, but this should be confirmed on a 12-lead ECG

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 


The 12-lead ECG confirms reversion to sinus rhythm and does not demonstrate any features of WPW. The diagnosis is [AV-nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT)](https://litfl.com/supraventricular-tachycardia-svt-ecg-library/).
