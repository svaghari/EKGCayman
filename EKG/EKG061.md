**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 


This pattern of deeply inverted T waves in the anterolateral leads V2-6, I and aVL is characteristic of [Wellens syndrome](https://litfl.com/wellens-syndrome-ecg-library/).

- This ECG pattern is highly predictive of a significant occlusive lesion of the LAD.
- The inverted T waves are a marker of reperfusion and may occur after an aborted [anterior STEMI](https://litfl.com/anterior-myocardial-infarction-ecg-library/).
- Despite often being pain free and having normal cardiac enzymes at presentation, these patients are at risk of sudden LAD re-occlusion leading to massive anterior STEMI and are best managed with early angiography and PCI / CABG.

**DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS** 


A similar pattern of deep anterolateral T-wave inversions may also be seen with:

- Apical [hypertrophic cardiomyopathy](https://litfl.com/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-hcm-ecg-library/) – suspect if associated [LVH](https://litfl.com/left-ventricular-hypertrophy-lvh-ecg-library/)
- [Raised intracranial pressure](https://litfl.com/raised-intracranial-pressure-ecg-library/) – patient will be comatose (see [Quiz ECG 012](https://litfl.com/ecg-case-012/))
