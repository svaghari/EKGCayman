# ECG Case 084


89 yr old female presents with chest pain. She has a history of 2nd degree AV block with PPM in-situ.


Serially ECGs were recorded



**ECG 1** ; on arrival pain 3/10

**Describe and interpret these ECGs** 

**ECG ANSWER – ECG 1** 


Key features:

- Rate 60 bpm
- Regular V-paced rhythm
- LBBB Morphology
- Discordant ST / T wave changes
- T waves in leads V2-4 appear prominent
- Concordant ST elevation in lead I with a positive QRS
	- Subtle and easy to miss

**ECG ANSWER – ECG 2** 


Key features:

- Rate 60 bpm
- Regular V-paced rhythm
- LBBB Morphology
- Significant progression of ST and T wave changes
	- Massive ST elevation (>5mm) in leads V2-4 also proportionately >25% of QRS depth
	- Discordant ST elevation in leads II, III, aVF, V5
		- Significantly more pronounced than on previous ECG
	- Concordant ST elevation in leads I and V6

**INTERPRETATION and OUTCOME** 


Sgarbossa positive ECG’s

- Dynamic and progressive ST segment changes
- Underlying V-paced rhythm with LBBB morphology


The patient was discussed with the cardiology team and taken for angiography.


This showed an acute mid LAD occlusion treated with a bare metal stent. Post angiography echo showed moderate systolic and diastolic dysfunction. She was discharged following a 2 day in-patient stay.
