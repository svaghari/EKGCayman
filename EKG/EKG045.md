**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 


This ECG shows a [ventricular paced rhythm](https://litfl.com/pacemaker-rhythms-normal-patterns/) with positive [Sgarbossa criteria](https://litfl.com/sgarbossa-criteria-ecg-library/):

- There is **concordant ST depression**  in V2-5. This violates the [expected pattern of discordance](https://litfl.com/sgarbossa-criteria-ecg-library/) for a V-paced rhythm and is a marker of superimposed **myocardial infarction** .
- The morphology in V2-5 is reminiscent of [posterior STEMI](https://litfl.com/posterior-myocardial-infarction-ecg-library/), with horizontal ST depression and prominent upright T waves.
- Multiple non-conducted P waves are seen, indicating the presence of underlying [high-grade AV block](https://litfl.com/av-block-2nd-degree-high-grade-av-block/) (probably the indication for pacemaker insertion). However, the [fusion complex](https://litfl.com/fusion-beat-dressler-beat-ecg-library/) (beat #5 on rhythm strip) suggests that P waves are occasionally transmitted, arguing against [complete heart block](https://litfl.com/av-block-3rd-degree-complete-heart-block/).


This patient did indeed have an isolated [posterior infarction](https://litfl.com/posterior-myocardial-infarction-ecg-library/), due to complete occlusion of a posterolateral branch of the RCA. She was successfully treated with PCI.

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 



**Sgarbossa Criteria** 


These criteria allow for detection of myocardial infarction in patients with [LBBB](https://litfl.com/left-bundle-branch-block-lbbb-ecg-library/) and [V-paced rhythms](https://litfl.com/pacemaker-rhythms-normal-patterns/) (previously thought to be “impossible”).



**Normal Pattern in LBBB / VPR** 


The expected finding in patients with uncomplicated LBBB / V-paced rhythm is **discordance**  — i.e. the ST segments and T waves point in the opposite direction to the QRS complex.

**How To Spot Superimposed MI** 


Superimposed myocardial infarction is suspected if there is either:

- Loss of the usual pattern of discordance — i.e. **concordant ST changes.** 
- **Excessive discordant ST elevation**  — i.e. out of proportion to what would be expected for LBBB / paced rhythm.

[Sgarbossa Criteria](https://litfl.com/sgarbossa-criteria-ecg-library/)


Diagnosis of MI in LBBB / VPR requires at least one of the following criteria to be present:

- Concordant ST depression > 1 mm in V1-3.
- Concordant ST elevation > 1 mm in any lead.
- Excessively discordant ST elevation in any lead >5 mm (original Sgarbossa criteria) or >25% of the corresponding S-wave depth ([modified Sgarbossa criteria](http://epmonthly.com/article/stemi-in-the-presence-of-lbbb/) = more specific).


Changes only have to be present in a single lead to be diagnostic of MI.
