**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 



**Main Abnormal Findings** 

- [Severe bradycardia](https://litfl.com/sinus-bradycardia-ecg-library/) of 36 bpm
- Rhythm is difficult to ascertain — appears irregular (?slow AF) although there are some small-voltage P waves seen in V1-2
- Broad QRS complexes with an [atypical LBBB morphology](https://litfl.com/left-bundle-branch-block-lbbb-ecg-library/)
- Subtle symmetrical peaking (“tenting”) of the T waves in V2-5



**Diagnosis** 


The combination of bradycardia, flattening and loss of P waves, QRS broadening and T wave abnormalities is highly suspicious for severe [hyperkalaemia.](https://litfl.com/hyperkalaemia-ecg-library/) This patient had a potassium of 8.0 in the context of anuric renal failure.

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 


When you see the combination of…

- Bradycardia
- Blocks — e.g. AV block, bundle branch blocks
- Bizarre QRS complexes


…. think [hyperkalaemia](https://litfl.com/hyperkalaemia-ecg-library/)!
The push-pull effect
![](https://litfl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PushPull-K-ECG.png)

- Hypokalaemia creates the illusion that the T wave is “pushed down”, with resultant T-wave flattening/inversion, ST depression, and prominent U waves
- In hyperkalaemia, the T wave is “pulled upwards”, creating tall “tented” T waves, and stretching the remainder of the ECG to cause P wave flattening, PR prolongation, and QRS widening
