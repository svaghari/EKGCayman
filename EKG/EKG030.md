**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 



**Main Abnormalities** 

- [Atrial tachycardia](https://litfl.com/atrial-tachycardia-ecg-library/), with regular P waves visible at ~ 160 bpm (many of the P waves are hidden within T waves and VEBs)
- Evidence of [high-grade AV block](https://litfl.com/av-block-2nd-degree-high-grade-av-block/) — there is a 4:1 conduction ratio between P waves and QRS complexes, with a QRS rate of ~ 40 bpm
- Frequent ventricular ectopic beats occurring in a pattern of [ventricular bigeminy](https://litfl.com/premature-ventricular-complex-pvc-ecg-library/)
- **Alternating LBBB and RBBB morphology** , with the conducted QRS complexes demonstrating [RBBB morphology](https://litfl.com/right-bundle-branch-block-rbbb-ecg-library/) (RSR’ in V1) and the VEBs demonstrating [LBBB morphology](https://litfl.com/left-bundle-branch-block-lbbb-ecg-library/) (dominant S wave in V1)

**Diagnosis** 


The combination of…

- Atrial tachycardia
- Frequent ventricular ectopic beats
- High-grade AV block


… is almost pathognomonic of [severe digoxin toxicity](https://litfl.com/digoxin-toxicity-ecg-library/).

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 



**ECG Features of Digoxin Toxicity** 


Digoxin toxicity produces a wide variety of dysrhythmias, due to:

- **Increased automaticity**  of atrial and ventricular tissues — via actions at the Na/K and Na/Ca exchangers causing increased intracellular calcium and therefore increased spontaneous depolarisation of cardiac pacemaker cells
- **Decreased AV conduction**  — via increased vagal tone at the AV node


Digoxin toxicity therefore usually produces some combination of:

- **Increased atrial automaticity**  — especially atrial tachycardia, but also [atrial ectopics](https://litfl.com/premature-atrial-complex-pac/), [AF](https://litfl.com/atrial-fibrillation-ecg-library/), [flutter](https://litfl.com/atrial-flutter-ecg-library/)
- **Increased ventricular automaticity**  — [frequent VEBs and bigeminy](https://litfl.com/premature-ventricular-complex-pvc-ecg-library/), [polymorphic VT](https://litfl.com/polymorphic-vt-and-torsades-de-pointes-tdp/)
- **AV blocks**  — including [1st](https://litfl.com/first-degree-heart-block-ecg-library/), [2nd](https://litfl.com/av-block-2nd-degree-mobitz-ii-hay-block/) and [3rd degree](https://litfl.com/av-block-3rd-degree-complete-heart-block/) AV block



**Characteristic ECG patterns include:** 

- [Atrial tachycardia with high-grade AV block](https://litfl.com/digoxin-toxicity-ecg-library/) (= the classic dig-toxic rhythm)
- [“Regularised AF”](https://litfl.com/digoxin-toxicity-ecg-library/) =  AF with complete heart block + accelerated junctional escape rhythm, producing a paradoxically regular rhythm
- [Bidirectional VT](https://litfl.com/bidirectional-ventricular-tachycardia-bvt-ecg-library/) = polymorphic VT with QRS complexes that alternate between left- and right-axis-deviation, or between LBBB and RBBB morphology


NB. Digoxin toxicity should not be confused with [digoxin effect](https://litfl.com/digoxin-effect-ecg-library/) (= “sagging” ST depression and T-wave inversion in patients on therapeutic doses of digoxin; not predictive of toxicity).
