**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 



**Main Abnormalities** 


This is a classic ECG of [tricyclic antidepressant toxicity](https://litfl.com/tricyclic-overdose-sodium-channel-blocker-toxicity/), demonstrating multiple characteristic abnormalities.



**Signs of sodium-channel blockade** 

- Broad QRS complexes (120 ms, or 3 small squares).
- Positive R’ wave in lead aVR > 3 mm.
- Prolonged PR interval (240 ms).
- Long QT interval (> 1/2 the RR interval).
- [Brugada-like](https://litfl.com/brugada-syndrome-ecg-library/) pattern in V1.



**Signs of anticholinergic toxidrome** 


Sinus tachycardia (~ 110 bpm), with P waves embedded in each T wave

This patient had taken a life-threatening overdose of dosulepin (a Tricyclic antidepressant TCA).



**How to Spot Sodium-Channel Blockade** 

- QRS prolongation (> 100ms or 2.5 small squares), typically measured in lead II.
- A terminal or secondary R wave (R’ wave) in aVR > 3 mm.
- An R’/S ratio in aVR > 0.7.



**Prognostic Value of the ECG** 


In patients with TCA overdose, the degree of QRS prolongation correlates with the degree of clinical toxicity:

- QRS width > 100 ms is predictive of seizures.
- QRS width > 160 ms is predictive of cardiotoxicity (e.g. broad-complex dysrhythmias, hypotension).

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 


The combination of PR prolongation and sinus tachycardia with TCA
overdose often makes the P waves difficult to see, and may lead the
rhythm to be incorrectly identified as VT. This patient needs
bicarbonate and hyperventilation, not electricity and amiodarone!


The clinical significance of a [TCA-induced Brugada ECG pattern r](https://europace.oxfordjournals.org/content/europace/11/8/989.full.pdf)emains controversial — i.e. is it purely a manifestation of severe sodium-channel blockade, or does it represent “unmasking” of underlying [Brugada syndrome](https://litfl.com/brugada-syndrome-ecg-library/)? These issues are discussed [here](https://europace.oxfordjournals.org/content/europace/11/8/989.full.pdf).
