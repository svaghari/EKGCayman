**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 


This rhythm is frequently misidentified as [atrial fibrillation](https://litfl.com/atrial-fibrillation-ecg-library/). However, note in this case:

- Well-defined **sawtooth**  waves in II, III, aVF with regular rate (~300bpm) and consistent morphology.
- Positive flutter waves (“pseudo-P waves”) in V1-2.
- The rhythm is not irregularly irregular. There are repeating patterns of identical R-R intervals that crop up throughout the rhythm strip, corresponding to AV conduction ratios of either 2:1 or 4:1.


This is [atrial flutter with a variable block](https://litfl.com/atrial-flutter-ecg-library/).

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 


Misidentifying this rhythm as AF is not normally a big problem as
both conditions are managed similarly — i.e. rate control,
anticoagulation.


However, [flutter will cardiovert with lower energy than AF](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines-&-Education/Journals-and-publications/ESC-journals-family/E-journal-of-Cardiology-Practice/Volume-11/Cardioversion-in-Atrial-Fibrillation-Described) — e.g. 50 j compared with 100-200 j.
