**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 


There are multiple features suggestive of [right ventricular hypertrophy](https://litfl.com/right-ventricular-hypertrophy-rvh-ecg-library/) or [RV strain](https://litfl.com/right-ventricular-strain-ecg-library/):

- [Right axis deviation](https://litfl.com/right-axis-deviation-rad-ecg-library/)
- [Dominant R wave in V1](https://litfl.com/r-wave-ecg-library/)
- [Right bundle branch block](https://litfl.com/right-bundle-branch-block-rbbb-ecg-library/)
- [Right ventricular strain pattern](https://litfl.com/right-ventricular-strain-ecg-library/) — T wave inversions in V1-4, lead III
- [SI QIII TIII  pattern](https://litfl.com/ecg-changes-in-pulmonary-embolism/)
- Clockwise rotation of the heart, with a persistent S wave in V6


Given the clinical history, the most likely scenario is [acute right heart strain](https://litfl.com/right-ventricular-strain-ecg-library/) due to [massive pulmonary embolism](https://litfl.com/ecg-changes-in-pulmonary-embolism/).


A similar ECG pattern may also be seen with [chronic cor pulmonale](https://litfl.com/ecg-in-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/), pulmonary hypertension or [RV hypertrophy (e.g. due to congenital heart disease)](https://litfl.com/right-ventricular-hypertrophy-rvh-ecg-library/).

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 



**ECG changes in pulmonary embolism include:** 

- **[Sinus tachycardia](https://litfl.com/sinus-tachycardia-ecg-library/) –**  the most common abnormality; seen in 44% of patients.
- **[Complete or incomplete RBBB](https://litfl.com/right-bundle-branch-block-rbbb-ecg-library/) –**  associated with increased mortality; seen in 18% of patients.
- **[Right ventricular strain pattern](https://litfl.com/right-ventricular-strain-ecg-library/) –**  T wave inversions in the right precordial leads (V1-4) ± the inferior leads (II, III, aVF). This pattern is seen in up to 34% of patients and is associated with high pulmonary artery pressures.
- **[Right axis deviation](https://litfl.com/right-axis-deviation-rad-ecg-library/)**  – seen in 16% of patients. Extreme right axis deviation may occur, with axis between zero and -90 degrees, giving the appearance of left axis deviation (“pseudo left axis”).
- **[Dominant R wave in V1](https://litfl.com/r-wave-ecg-library/)** – a manifestation of acute right ventricular dilatation.
- **[Right atrial enlargement (P pulmonale)](https://litfl.com/right-atrial-enlargement-ecg-library/) –** peaked P wave in lead II > 2.5 mm in height. Seen in 9% of patients.
- **[SI QIII TIII  pattern](https://litfl.com/ecg-changes-in-pulmonary-embolism/)**  – deep S wave in lead I, Q wave in III, inverted T wave in III. This “classic” finding is neither sensitive nor specific for pulmonary embolism; found in only 20% of patients with PE.
- **[Clockwise rotation](https://litfl.com/ecg-in-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/) –** shift of the R/S transition point towards V6 with a persistent S wave in V6 (“pulmonary disease pattern”), implying rotation of the heart due to right ventricular dilatation.
- **Atrial tachyarrhythmias –**  [AF](https://litfl.com/atrial-fibrillation-ecg-library/), [flutter](https://litfl.com/atrial-flutter-ecg-library/), [atrial tachycardia](https://litfl.com/atrial-tachycardia-ecg-library/). Seen in 8% of patients.
- **Non-specific ST segment and T wave changes** , including ST elevation and depression. Reported in up to 50% of patients with PE.


Simultaneous T wave inversions in the inferior (II, III, aVF) and
right precordial leads (V1-4) is the most specific finding in favour of
PE.
