**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 



**Main Abnormalities** 


This ECG is diagnostic of the [Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome](https://litfl.com/pre-excitation-syndromes-ecg-library/):

- Sinus rhythm with a very [short PR interval](https://litfl.com/pr-interval-ecg-library/) (< 120ms)
- Broad QRS complexes
- [Delta waves](https://litfl.com/delta-wave-ecg-library/) = slurred upstroke to the QRS



**Other Features:** 

- Dominant S wave in V1 — this “**type B** ” pattern indicates a right-sided accessory pathway
- Tall R waves and inverted T waves mimic the appearance of [LVH](https://litfl.com/left-ventricular-hypertrophy-lvh-ecg-library/) — this is an electrical phenomenon due to WPW and not a sign of ventricular hypertrophy
- ST segments and T waves show typical “discordant” changes — they point in in the opposite direction to the QRS complex, similar to [LBBB](https://litfl.com/left-bundle-branch-block-lbbb-ecg-library/)
