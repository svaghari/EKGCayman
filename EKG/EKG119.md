# ECG Case 119


A 34 year-old male presents to your emergency department with palpitations. His vitals checked at triage include pulse >170; BP 112/76; sO2 98%; GCS 15

We presented the ECG to the [medical Twitter community](https://twitter.com/rob_buttner/status/1367016544903962624) and asked what they would do, and what was the most likely ECG diagnosis:

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 


On first glance this may appear to be [SVT](https://litfl.com/supraventricular-tachycardia-svt-ecg-library/) with [LBBB](https://litfl.com/left-bundle-branch-block-lbbb-ecg-library/) as there is:

- Regular broad-complex tachycardia, rate 174
- Typical LBBB morphology in aVR, V1 and V6
- Absence of fusion or capture beats


However, there is **one feature**  here that is unusual for LBBB, can you spot it?

**Reveal answer** 


There is an [inferior axis](https://litfl.com/right-axis-deviation-rad-ecg-library/) (+90 degrees), which is atypical for LBBB. LBBB normally has a [leftward axis](https://litfl.com/left-axis-deviation-lad-ecg-library/).


The combination of a regular broad complex tachycardia with typical LBBB morphology, and inferior axis (+90 degrees), should raise suspicion for a form of monomorphic VT known as [right ventricular outflow-tract tachycardia](https://litfl.com/right-ventricular-outflow-tract-rvot-tachycardia/) (RVOT tachycardia).


In addition, there are **other features**  suggestive of VT, can you spot them?

**Reveal answer** 


There are signs of **AV dissociation,**  with P waves discernible at different rates to QRS complexes (sensitivity 82%, specificity 98%):

The initial R wave in V1 measures ~40ms:

- With a dominant S wave in V1, an initial R wave of > 30-40ms is also suggestive of VT (Brugada algorithm)

**Pathophysiology** 


The differential diagnosis of a regular broad complex tachycardia is VT versus SVT with aberrant conduction (due to bundle branch block or Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome). For an in-depth review of differentiating between the two, see [VT versus SVT](https://litfl.com/vt-versus-svt-ecg-library/).


RVOT tachycardia is a form of monomorphic VT originating from the outflow tract of the right ventricle or occasionally from the tricuspid annulus. It is most commonly a form of idiopathic VT, whereby no structural heart disease, metabolic/electrolyte abnormalities, or long QT syndrome can be found. It can also be seen in patients with [Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia (ARVD)](https://litfl.com/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy-arvc/).


The RVOT is divided into rightward (free wall), anterior, leftward, and posterior (septal) parts. RVOT tachycardia can originate from any of these sites but all carry common ECG characteristics.**ECG features of RVOT VT:**
