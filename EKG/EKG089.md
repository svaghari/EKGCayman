**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 


Rate:


- 120 bpm


Rhythm:


- Regularly irregular
- Bigeminy 
	- Alternating sinus complex and PVC


Axis:


- Sinus complex – normal axis
- PVC – extreme axis


Intervals- Sinus Complex:


- PR – Normal (~200ms)
- QRS – Normal (100ms)
- QT – 480ms


Intervals- PVC’s:


- QRS – Prolonged (120ms)


Segments – Sinus complexes:

- ST Elevation leads V2 (2mm) V3 (3mm) V4 (2mm) V5 (2mm) V6 (1mm)


Additional:

-  T inversion lead aVL
- Hyperacute T waves leads V2-4
- Excessive discordant ST elevation in the PVC’s leads V2-6 – see edited ECG’s below


Interpretation:

- Anterolateral STEMI
- Bigeminy

**OUTCOME** 


The patient was taken for urgent angiography and PCI and has a mid-LAD lesion stented.


Whilst the key features on this ECG and reasonably apparent the presence of frequent PVC can distract the eye and male interpretation difficult. I’ve edits the ECG below to show only the sinus complexes.

The ECG below is edited to only show the PVC’s as they exhibit excessive discordant ST elevation due to concurrent infarction.
