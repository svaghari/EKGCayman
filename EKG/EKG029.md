**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 



**Main Findings** 

- Irregular narrow-complex rhythm ([overall rate = 72 bpm](https://litfl.com/ecg-rate-interpretation/))
- [Normal sinus P waves](https://litfl.com/p-wave-ecg-library/) are seen (upright in lead II), indicating a sinus origin of the rhythm
- QRS complexes cluster in groups, separated by non-conducted P waves
- The PR interval progressively prolongs within each group
- The PR prolongation can be appreciated by comparing the first and last PR interval of each group



**Diagnosis** 


This is the typical appearance of 2nd degree AV block with Mobitz I conduction ([Wenckebach phenomenon](https://litfl.com/av-block-2nd-degree-mobitz-i-wenckebach-phenomenon/)).

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 



**Clinical Significance** 


In comparison to patients with [Mobitz II](https://litfl.com/av-block-2nd-degree-mobitz-ii-hay-block/), who typically require a pacemaker for prophylaxis of [complete heart block](https://litfl.com/av-block-3rd-degree-complete-heart-block/) and ventricular standstill, patients with Mobitz I do not necessarily need any intervention. 


This is provided that they are asymptomatic with a normal BP, and that reversible causes such as drug toxicity ([beta-lockers](https://litfl.com/beta-blocker-and-calcium-channel-blocker-toxicity/), [digoxin](https://litfl.com/digoxin-toxicity-ecg-library/)), [hyperkalaemia](https://litfl.com/hyperkalaemia-ecg-library/) and [myocardial ischaemia](https://litfl.com/inferior-stemi-ecg-library/) have been excluded. 


The risk of progression to haemodynamically unstable AV block in these patients is very low.
