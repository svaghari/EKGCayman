ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION


**Main Abnormalities:**
- Irregularly irregular broad complex tachycardia
- Extremely [rapid ventricular rates](https://litfl.com/ecg-rate-interpretation/) — up to 300 bpm in places (RR intervals as short as 200ms or 1 large square)
- Beat-to-beat variability in the QRS morphology, with subtle variation in QRS width


**Explanation of ECG Findings:**
- Irregularly irregular rhythm is consistent with [atrial fibrillation](https://litfl.com/atrial-fibrillation-ecg-library/)
- There is a [left bundle branch block](https://litfl.com/left-bundle-branch-block-lbbb-ecg-library/) morphology to the QRS complexes
- However, the ventricular rate is far too rapid for this to be simply AF with LBBB
- The rates of 250-300 bpm and the variability in QRS complex morphology indicate the existence of an [accessory pathway](https://litfl.com/pre-excitation-syndromes-ecg-library/) between the atria and ventricles


**Diagnosis:**
- These findings indicate [atrial fibrillation](https://litfl.com/atrial-fibrillation-ecg-library/) in the context of [Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome](https://litfl.com/pre-excitation-syndromes-ecg-library/)![](https://litfl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPW-ecg-005.jpeg)Post reversion ECG

CLINICAL PEARLS
- Broad complex irregular tachycardia at very rapid rates? -> Suspect AF with WPW!
- These patients can rapidly become haemodynamically unstable
- The options for chemical cardioversion are very limited, favouring DC cardioversion


We would recommend immediate DC cardioversion in this patient. Our approach would be:
- Fluid load with 0.5 – 1L crystalloid bolus
- Add in a push-dose vasopressor to elevate the BP (e.g. Metaraminol 0.5 – 1mg IV)
- Sedate with something that has minimal effects on BP (e.g. fentanyl or ketamine in cautious doses) 
- Shock at 200J biphasic. Consider using an AP pad position for maximal 1st shock success
