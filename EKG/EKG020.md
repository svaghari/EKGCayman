**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 



**Main Abnormalities** 

- Runs of tachycardia are interspersed with long sinus pauses (up to 6 seconds)
- The sinus rate is extremely slow, varying from 40 bpm down to around 10 bpm in places
- Sinus beats are followed by paroxysms of junctional tachycardia at around 140 bpm



**Diagnosis** 

- This is a good example of [sick sinus syndrome](https://litfl.com/sinus-node-dysfunction-sick-sinus-syndrome/) leading to the tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome
- The flurries of junctional tachycardia are a compensatory phenomenon attempting to maintain cardiac output in the face of critically low sinus node rates
- The syncope likely occurred due to a long sinus pause with temporary loss of cardiac output. This patient needs a pacemaker!
