**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 


This ECG demonstrates many of the features of [chronic pulmonary disease](https://litfl.com/ecg-in-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/):

- Rightward QRS axis (+90 degrees)
- Peaked P waves in the inferior leads > 2.5 mm ([P pulmonale](https://litfl.com/right-atrial-enlargement-ecg-library/))
- Rightward P-wave axis (inverted in aVL)
- “Clockwise rotation” of the heart with a delayed R/S transition point (transitional lead = V5)
- Absent R waves in the right precordial leads (SV1-SV2-SV3 pattern)
- Low voltages in the left-sided leads (I, aVL, V5-6)


Tachycardia may be due to dyspnoea, hypoxia or beta-agonist treatment. This ECG pattern is a common finding in patients with COPD. The inferior axis (+90 degrees) is due to hyperinflation of the lungs causing vertical orientation of the heart.
