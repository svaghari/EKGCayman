# ECG Case 085


56 yr old male who present with 2 hours of chest pain. Past history of hypertension and smoking. The ECG’s were performed 15 mins apart with ongoing chest pain.

**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER – ECG 1** 


Rate:


- 72 bpm


Rhythm:


- Sinus rhythm
- Single PAC (Complex #7)


Axis:


- Normal 


Intervals:


- PR – Normal (160ms)
- QRS – Normal (100ms)
- QT – 360ms


Segments:

- ST Depression leads I, V4-6



**Interpretation:** 

- Lateral ST segment depression
	- Given associated Hx of chest pain ischaemia is the main concern

**ECG ANSWER – ECG 2** 


Rate:


- 72 bpm


Rhythm:


- Regular
- Sinus rhythm


Axis:


- Normal 


Intervals:


- PR – Normal (180-200ms)
- QRS – Normal (80ms)
- QT – 360ms


Segments:

- ST Depression leads I, II, aVL, V2-6
- ST Elevation lead aVR (~1mm)


Additional:

- Markedly prominent T waves leads I, V2-6



**Interpretation:** 

- De Winter T Wave Pattern
	- Suggests acute LAD lesion requiring emergent reperfusion 
- Dynamic ECG changes compared with previous ECG

**OUTCOME** 


The ECG changes were recognised by the treating team. The patient was taken for emergency PCI which showed:

- LAD – 100% Occlusion – 2 x stents inserted
- RAC – 30% proximal stenosis


Post stent echocardiogram showed:

- Mild systolic dysfunction
- Akinesis of anterior septum and apical region
- LVEF ~40-45%


The patient was discharged after a 4 day in-patient stay.


I think there are two key learning points from this case:
- The need for serial ECG’s
- Recognition of De Winter’s T Wave Pattern
