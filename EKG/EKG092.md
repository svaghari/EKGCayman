# ECG Case 092


33 year old male presents with shortness of breath and dizziness during an indoor soccer game.


Two ECGs were taken, seven minutes apart



**ECG 1** ; on arrival

**Describe and interpret these ECGs** 

**ECG ANSWER – ECG 1** 


Rate:

- 78


Rhythm:


- Regular
- Sinus Rhythm


Axis:

- Normal (65 deg)


Intervals:

- PR – Short (~100-110 ms)
- QRS – Prolonged (120ms)
- QT – 360ms (QTc Bazett ~ 410 ms)


Segments:

- Discordant ST depression V2-5, II, III, aVF
- Minor discordant ST elevation aVR, aVL


Additional:

- Delta wave – slurred upstroke of QRS complexes best seen V2-6, II, III, aVF
- Negative QRS deflection aVL – pseudo-infarction pattern
- T Inversion V1-5, II, III, aVF
- Prominent R waves – R/S > 1 in Lead V1 – likely pseudo-hypertrophy


Interpretation:

- Wolff-Parkinson-White (Type A Pattern) 
- …whilst the ST changes are most likely due to WPW we should consider the possibility of ischaemia / infarction. Remember serial ECGs and clinical correlation.


See also this article by Khan et al. which goes through two cases and looks at the patterns of pseudo-hypertrophy and pseudo-infarction that can accompany WPW.

**ECG ANSWER – ECG 2** 


Rate:

- 72


Rhythm:

- Regular
- Sinus Rhythm


Axis:

- Normal (~40 deg)


Intervals:

- PR – Normal (~200ms)
- QRS – Normal (80-100ms)
- QT – 320ms (QTc Bazett ~ 350 ms)


Segments:

- Slight Concave ST Elevation V1-3


Additional:

- U Waves V2-4
- Notching of QRS Complexes seen best in V3, III
- Q wave aVL looks >25% of associated R wave
- Compared with ECG 1; resolution of features of WPW



**Interpretation:** 


- **Intermittent Pre-Excitation** 

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 


There is a great case review of intermittent pre-excitation during sedation by Wakita el al which includes a review of some of the literature. Wakita et al quotes the incidence of intermittent pre-excitation to be between 20 – 60% of all cases of WPW.
