**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 



**Main Abnormalities** 

- Bizarre appearing complexes
- Marked T wave peaking in V2-6.
- Gross QRS prolongation (~200 ms)
- Some leads (I, aVR) are starting to take on a sine wave appearance



**Diagnosis** 


The combination of…

- Bizarre complexes
- QRS prolongation
- Peaked T waves
- Sine wave appearance


… are all strongly suggestive of [severe hyperkalemia](https://litfl.com/hyperkalaemia-ecg-library/).


This patient had a serum K of 9.2 mmol/L!


In this elderly patient with multiple medical problems, causes could include renal failure (e.g. due to diuretics, NSAIDs, intercurrent illness) or treatment with ACE-inhibitors, spironalactone or K-supplements.

**CLINICAL PEARLS** **The push-pull effect** 
![](https://litfl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PushPull-K-ECG.png)

- Hypokalaemia creates the illusion that the T wave is “pushed down”, with resultant T-wave flattening/inversion, ST depression, and prominent U waves
- In hyperkalaemia, the T wave is “pulled upwards”, creating tall “tented” T waves, and stretching the remainder of the ECG to cause P wave flattening, PR prolongation, and QRS widening
