**Describe and interpret this ECG** 

**ECG ANSWER and INTERPRETATION** 



**Main Abnormalities** 

- Markedly peaked T waves in V2-6.
- Extremely short QT interval (~240 ms).


In a patient presenting with syncope, this ECG pattern is very suspicious for the [short QT syndrome](https://litfl.com/short-qt-syndrome-ecg-library/).



**Short QT Syndrome** 

- This is a recently-described arrhythmogenic condition associated with paroxysmal [atrial](https://litfl.com/atrial-fibrillation-ecg-library/) and [ventricular fibrillation](https://litfl.com/ventricular-fibrillation-vf-ecg-library/).
- The hallmark is a significantly shortened QT interval (at least < 360 ms, often < 330 ms) with associated T-wave peaking.
- SQTS is a genetically-inherited cardiac channelopathy on the same spectrum as other familial arrhythmogenic diseases such as [Long QT Syndrome](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/157826-overview?cc=aHR0cDovL2VtZWRpY2luZS5tZWRzY2FwZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xNTc4MjYtb3ZlcnZpZXc=&cookieCheck=1) (LQTS), [Brugada Syndrome](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/163751-overview) and [Catecholaminergic Polymorphic  Ventricular Tachycardia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1289/) (CPVT).

**CLINICAL PEARLS** 



**When to Suspect SQTS** 

- Any patient with a QT interval < 330 ms.
- QT interval < 360 ms and convincing symptoms (syncope, cardiac arrest) or family history.



**Differential Diagnosis** 

- Peaked T waves and short QT interval may be seen with [severe hyperkalaemia](https://litfl.com/hyperkalaemia-ecg-library/).
- A shortened QT interval may also be seen with [severe hypercalcaemia](https://litfl.com/hypercalcaemia-ecg-library/).
